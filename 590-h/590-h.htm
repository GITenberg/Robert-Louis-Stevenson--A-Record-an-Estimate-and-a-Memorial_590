<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<p>A few words may here be allowed me to explain one or two 
points.&nbsp; First, about the facsimile of last page of Preface 
to <i>Familiar Studies of Men and Books</i>.&nbsp; Stevenson was 
in Davos when the greater portion of that work went through the 
press.&nbsp; He felt so much the disadvantage of being there in 
the circumstances (both himself and his wife ill) that he begged 
me to read the proofs of the Preface for him.&nbsp; This illness 
has record in the letter from him (pp. 28-29).&nbsp; The 
printers, of course, had directions to send the copy and proofs 
of the Preface to me.&nbsp; Hence I am able now to give this 
facsimile.</p>
<p>With regard to the letter at p. 19, of which facsimile is also
given, what Stevenson there meant is not the &ldquo;three 
last&rdquo; of that batch, but the three last sent to me 
before&mdash;though that was an error on his part&mdash;he only 
then sent two chapters, making the &ldquo;eleven chapters 
now&rdquo;&mdash;sent to me by post.</p>
<p>Another point on which I might have dwelt and illustrated by 
many instances is this, that though Stevenson was fond of 
hob-nobbing with all sorts and conditions of men, this desire of 
wide contact and intercourse has little show in his 
novels&mdash;the ordinary fibre of commonplace human beings not 
receiving much celebration from him there; another case in which 
his private bent and sympathies received little illustration in 
his novels.&nbsp; But the fact lies implicit in much I have 
written.</p>
<p>I have to thank many authors for permission to quote extracts 
I have used.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I&mdash;INTRODUCTION AND FIRST IMPRESSIONS</h2>
<p>My little effort to make Thoreau better known in England had 
one result that I am pleased to think of.&nbsp; It brought me 
into personal association with R. L. Stevenson, who had written 
and published in <i>The Cornhill Magazine</i> an essay on 
Thoreau, in whom he had for some time taken an interest.&nbsp; He
found in Thoreau not only a rare character for originality, 
courage, and indefatigable independence, but also a master of 
style, to whom, on this account, as much as any, he was inclined 
to play the part of the &ldquo;sedulous ape,&rdquo; as he had 
acknowledged doing to many others&mdash;a later exercise, perhaps
in some ways as fruitful as any that had gone before.&nbsp; A 
recent poet, having had some seeds of plants sent to him from 
Northern Scotland to the South, celebrated his setting of them 
beside those native to the Surrey slope on which he dwelt, with 
the lines&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And when the Northern seeds are growing,<br
/>
Another beauty then bestowing,<br />
We shall be fine, and North to South<br />
Be giving kisses, mouth to mouth.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the Thoreau influence on Stevenson was as if a tart 
American wild-apple had been grafted on an English pippin, and 
produced a wholly new kind with the flavours of both; and here 
wild America and England kissed each other mouth to mouth.</p>
<p>The direct result was the essay in <i>The Cornhill</i>, but 
the indirect results were many and less easily assessed, as 
Stevenson himself, as we shall see, was ever ready to 
admit.&nbsp; The essay on Thoreau was written in America, which 
further, perhaps, bears out my point.</p>
<p>One of the authorities, quoted by Mr Hammerton, in 
<i>Stevensoniana</i> says of the circumstances in which he found 
our author, when he was busily engaged on that bit of work:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have visited him in a lonely lodging in 
California, it was previous to his happy marriage, and found him 
submerged in billows of bed-clothes; about him floated the 
scattered volumes of a complete set of Thoreau; he was preparing 
an essay on that worthy, and he looked at the moment like a 
half-drowned man, yet he was not cast down.&nbsp; His work, an 
endless task, was better than a straw to him.&nbsp; It was to 
become his life-preserver and to prolong his years.&nbsp; I feel 
convinced that without it he must have surrendered long 
since.&nbsp; I found Stevenson a man of the frailest physique, 
though most unaccountably tenacious of life; a man whose pen was 
indefatigable, whose brain was never at rest, who, as far as I am
able to judge, looked upon everybody and everything from a 
supremely intellectual point of view.&rdquo;&nbsp; <a 
name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1" 
class="citation">[1]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We remember the common belief in Yorkshire and other parts 
that a man could not die so long as he could stand up&mdash;a 
belief on which poor Branwell Bront&euml; was fain to act and to 
illustrate, but R. L. Stevenson illustrated it, as this writer 
shows, in a better, calmer, and healthier way, despite his lack 
of health.</p>
<p>On some little points of fact, however, Stevenson was wrong; 
and I wrote to the Editor of <i>The Spectator</i> a letter, 
titled, I think, &ldquo;Thoreau&rsquo;s Pity and Humour,&rdquo; 
which he inserted.&nbsp; This brought me a private letter from 
Stevenson, who expressed the wish to see me, and have some talk 
with me on that and other matters.&nbsp; To this letter I at once
replied, directing to 17 Heriot Row, Edinburgh, saying that, as I
was soon to be in that City, it might be possible for me to see 
him there.&nbsp; In reply to this letter Mr Stevenson wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">The Cottage, Castleton of Braemar</span>,<br />
<i>Sunday</i>, <i>August</i> (? <i>th</i>), 1881.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I should 
long ago have written to thank you for your kind and frank 
letter; but, in my state of health, papers are apt to get 
mislaid, and your letter has been vainly hunted for until this 
(Sunday) morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must first say a word as to not quoting your book by 
name.&nbsp; It was the consciousness that we disagreed which led 
me, I daresay, wrongly, to suppress <i>all</i> references 
throughout the paper.&nbsp; But you may be certain a proper 
reference will now be introduced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I regret I shall not be able to see you in Edinburgh: 
one visit to Edinburgh has already cost me too dear in that 
invaluable particular, health; but if it should be at all 
possible for you to pass by Braemar, I believe you would find an 
attentive listener, and I can offer you a bed, a drive, and 
necessary food.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If, however, you should not be able to come thus far, I
can promise two things.&nbsp; First, I shall religiously revise 
what I have written, and bring out more clearly the point of view
from which I regarded Thoreau.&nbsp; Second, I shall in the 
preface record your objection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The point of view (and I must ask you not to forget 
that any such short paper is essentially only a <i>section 
through</i> a man) was this: I desired to look at the man through
his books.&nbsp; Thus, for instance, when I mentioned his return 
to the pencil-making, I did it only in passing (perhaps I was 
wrong), because it seemed to me not an illustration of his 
principles, but a brave departure from them.&nbsp; Thousands of 
such there were I do not doubt; still they might be hardly to my 
purpose; though, as you say so, I suppose some of them would 
be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our difference as to &lsquo;pity,&rsquo; I suspect, was
a logomachy of my making.&nbsp; No pitiful acts, on his part, 
would surprise me: I know he would be more pitiful in practice 
than most of the whiners; but the spirit of that practice would 
still seem to me to be unjustly described by the word pity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I try to be measured, I find myself usually 
suspected of a sneaking unkindness for my subject, but you may be
sure, sir, I would give up most other things to be as good a man 
as Thoreau.&nbsp; Even my knowledge of him leads me thus far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you find yourself able to push on so 
far&mdash;it may even lie on your way&mdash;believe me your visit
will be very welcome.&nbsp; The weather is cruel, but the place 
is, as I daresay you know, the very <i>wale</i> of 
Scotland&mdash;bar Tummelside.&mdash;Yours very sincerely,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Robert Louis 
Stevenson</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="Manuscript letter by R.L.S." src="images/p6s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Some delay took place in my leaving London for Scotland, and 
hence what seemed a hitch.&nbsp; I wrote mentioning the reason of
my delay, and expressing the fear that I might have to forego the
prospect of seeing him in Braemar, as his circumstances might 
have altered in the meantime.&nbsp; In answer came this note, 
like so many, if not most of his, indeed, without 
date:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">The 
Cottage, Castleton of Braemar</span>.<br />
(<i>No date</i>.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am here
as yet a fixture, and beg you to come our way.&nbsp; Would 
Tuesday or Wednesday suit you by any chance?&nbsp; We shall then,
I believe, be empty: a thing favourable to talks.&nbsp; You get 
here in time for dinner.&nbsp; I stay till near the end of 
September, unless, as may very well be, the weather drive me 
forth.&mdash;Yours very sincerely, <span class="smcap">Robert 
Louis Stevenson</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I accordingly went to Braemar, where he and his wife and her 
son were staying with his father and mother.</p>
<p>These were red-letter days in my calendar alike on account of 
pleasant intercourse with his honoured father and himself.&nbsp; 
Here is my pen-and-ink portrait of R. L. Stevenson, thrown down 
at the time:</p>
<p>Mr Stevenson&rsquo;s is, indeed, a very picturesque and 
striking figure.&nbsp; Not so tall probably as he seems at first 
sight from his extreme thinness, but the pose and air could not 
be otherwise described than as distinguished.&nbsp; Head of fine 
type, carried well on the shoulders and in walking with the 
impression of being a little thrown back; long brown hair, 
falling from under a broadish-brimmed Spanish form of soft felt 
hat, Rembrandtesque; loose kind of Inverness cape when walking, 
and invariable velvet jacket inside the house.&nbsp; You would 
say at first sight, wherever you saw him, that he was a man of 
intellect, artistic and individual, wholly out of the 
common.&nbsp; His face is sensitive, full of expression, though 
it could not be called strictly beautiful.&nbsp; It is longish, 
especially seen in profile, and features a little irregular; the 
brow at once high and broad.&nbsp; A hint of vagary, and just a 
hint in the expression, is qualified by the eyes, which are set 
rather far apart from each other as seems, and with a most 
wistful, and at the same time possibly a merry impish expression 
arising over that, yet frank and clear, piercing, but at the same
time steady, and fall on you with a gentle radiance and animation
as he speaks.&nbsp; Romance, if with an indescribable 
<i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of whimsicality, is marked upon him; 
sometimes he has the look as of the Ancient Mariner, and could 
fix you with his glittering e&rsquo;e, and he would, as he points
his sentences with a movement of his thin white forefinger, when 
this is not monopolised with the almost incessant 
cigarette.&nbsp; There is a faint suggestion of a hair-brained 
sentimental trace on his countenance, but controlled, after all, 
by good Scotch sense and shrewdness.&nbsp; In conversation he is 
very animated, and likes to ask questions.&nbsp; A favourite and 
characteristic attitude with him was to put his foot on a chair 
or stool and rest his elbow on his knee, with his chin on his 
hand; or to sit, or rather to half sit, half lean, on the corner 
of a table or desk, one of his legs swinging freely, and when 
anything that tickled him was said he would laugh in the 
heartiest manner, even at the risk of bringing on his cough, 
which at that time was troublesome.&nbsp; Often when he got 
animated he rose and walked about as he spoke, as if movement 
aided thought and expression.&nbsp; Though he loved Edinburgh, 
which was full of associations for him, he had no good word for 
its east winds, which to him were as death.&nbsp; Yet he passed 
one winter as a &ldquo;Silverado squatter,&rdquo; the story of 
which he has inimitably told in the volume titled <i>The 
Silverado Squatters</i>; and he afterwards spent several winters 
at Davos Platz, where, as he said to me, he not only breathed 
good air, but learned to know with closest intimacy John 
Addington Symonds, who &ldquo;though his books were good, was far
finer and more interesting than any of his books.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
needed a good deal of nursery attentions, but his invalidism was 
never obtrusively brought before one in any sympathy-seeking way 
by himself; on the contrary, a very manly, self-sustaining spirit
was evident; and the amount of work which he managed to turn out 
even when at his worst was truly surprising.</p>
<p>His wife, an American lady, is highly cultured, and is herself
an author.&nbsp; In her speech there is just the slightest 
suggestion of the American accent, which only made it the more 
pleasing to my ear.&nbsp; She is heart and soul devoted to her 
husband, proud of his achievements, and her delight is the 
consciousness of substantially aiding him in his enterprises.</p>
<p>They then had with them a boy of eleven or twelve, Samuel 
Lloyd Osbourne, to be much referred to later (a son of Mrs 
Stevenson by a former marriage), whose delight was to draw the 
oddest, but perhaps half intentional or unintentional 
caricatures, funny, in some cases, beyond expression.&nbsp; His 
room was designated the picture-gallery, and on entering I could 
scarce refrain from bursting into laughter, even at the general 
effect, and, noticing this, and that I was putting some restraint
on myself out of respect for the host&rsquo;s feelings, Stevenson
said to me with a sly wink and a gentle dig in the ribs, 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s laugh and be thankful here.&rdquo;&nbsp; On 
Lloyd&rsquo;s account simple engraving materials, types, and a 
small printing-press had been procured; and it was 
Stevenson&rsquo;s delight to make funny poems, stories, and 
morals for the engravings executed, and all would be duly printed
together.&nbsp; Stevenson&rsquo;s thorough enjoyment of the 
picture-gallery, and his goodness to Lloyd, becoming himself a 
very boy for the nonce, were delightful to witness and in degree 
to share.&nbsp; Wherever they were&mdash;at Braemar, in 
Edinburgh, at Davos Platz, or even at Silverado&mdash;the 
engraving and printing went on.&nbsp; The mention of the 
picture-gallery suggests that it was out of his interest in the 
colour-drawing and the picture-gallery that his first published 
story, <i>Treasure Island</i>, grew, as we shall see.</p>
<p>I have some copies of the rude printing-press productions, 
inexpressibly quaint, grotesque, a kind of literary horse-play, 
yet with a certain squint-eyed, sprawling genius in it, and 
innocent childish Rabelaisian mirth of a sort.&nbsp; At all 
events I cannot look at the slight memorials of that time, which 
I still possess, without laughing afresh till my eyes are 
dewy.&nbsp; Stevenson, as I understood, began <i>Treasure 
Island</i> more to entertain Lloyd Osbourne than anything else; 
the chapters being regularly read to the family circle as they 
were written, and with scarcely a purpose beyond.&nbsp; The lad 
became Stevenson&rsquo;s trusted companion and 
collaborator&mdash;clearly with a touch of genius.</p>
<p>I have before me as I write some of these funny momentoes of 
that time, carefully kept, often looked at.&nbsp; One of them is,
&ldquo;<i>The Black Canyon</i>; <i>or</i>, <i>Wild Adventures in 
the Far West</i>: a Tale of Instruction and Amusement for the 
Young, by Samuel L. Osbourne, printed by the author; Davos 
Platz,&rdquo; with the most remarkable cuts.&nbsp; It would not 
do some of the sensationalists anything but good to read it even 
at this day, since many points in their art are absurdly 
caricatured.&nbsp; Another is &ldquo;<i>Moral Emblems</i>; <i>a 
Collection of Cuts and Verses</i>, by R. L. Stevenson, author of 
the <i>Blue Scalper</i>, etc., etc.&nbsp; Printers, S. L. 
Osbourne and Company, Davos Platz.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here are the 
lines to a rare piece of grotesque, titled <i>A Peak in 
Darien</i>&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Broad-gazing on untrodden lands,<br />
See where adventurous Cortez stands,<br />
While in the heavens above his head,<br />
The eagle seeks its daily bread.<br />
How aptly fact to fact replies,<br />
Heroes and eagles, hills and skies.<br />
Ye, who contemn the fatted slave,<br />
Look on this emblem and be brave.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another, <i>The Elephant</i>, has these lines&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;See in the print how, moved by whim,<br />
Trumpeting Jumbo, great and grim,<br />
Adjusts his trunk, like a cravat,<br />
To noose that individual&rsquo;s hat;<br />
The Sacred Ibis in the distance, <br />
Joys to observe his bold resistance.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>R. L. Stevenson wrote from Davos Platz, in sending me <i>The 
Black Canyon</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sam sends as a present a work of his 
own.&nbsp; I hope you feel flattered, for <i>this is simply the 
first time he has ever given one away</i>.&nbsp; I have to buy my
own works, I can tell you.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later he said, in sending a second:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I own I have delayed this letter till I 
could forward the enclosed.&nbsp; Remembering the night at 
Braemar, when we visited the picture-gallery, I hope it may amuse
you: you see we do some publishing hereaway.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Delightfully suggestive and highly enjoyable, too, were the 
meetings in the little drawing-room after dinner, when the 
contrasted traits of father and son came into full 
play&mdash;when R. L. Stevenson would sometimes draw out a new 
view by bold, half-paradoxical assertion, or compel advance on 
the point from a new quarter by a searching question couched in 
the simplest language, or reveal his own latest conviction 
finally, by a few sentences as nicely rounded off as though they 
had been written, while he rose and gently moved about, as his 
habit was, in the course of those more extended remarks.&nbsp; 
Then a chapter or two of <i>The Sea-Cook</i> would be read, with 
due pronouncement on the main points by one or other of the 
family audience.</p>
<p>The reading of the book is one thing.&nbsp; It was quite 
another thing to hear Stevenson as he stood reading it aloud, 
with his hand stretched out holding the manuscript, and his body 
gently swaying as a kind of rhythmical commentary on the 
story.&nbsp; His fine voice, clear and keen it some of its tones,
had a wonderful power of inflection and variation, and when he 
came to stand in the place of Silver you could almost have 
imagined you saw the great one-legged John Silver, joyous-eyed, 
on the rolling sea.&nbsp; Yes, to read it in print was good, but 
better yet to hear Stevenson read it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II&mdash;<i>TREASURE ISLAND</i> AND SOME 
REMINISCENCES</h2>
<p>When I left Braemar, I carried with me a considerable portion 
of the MS. of <i>Treasure Island</i>, with an outline of the rest
of the story.&nbsp; It originally bore the odd title of <i>The 
Sea-Cook</i>, and, as I have told before, I showed it to Mr 
Henderson, the proprietor of the <i>Young Folks&rsquo; Paper</i>,
who came to an arrangement with Mr Stevenson, and the story duly 
appeared in its pages, as well as the two which succeeded it.</p>
<p>Stevenson himself in his article in <i>The Idler</i> for 
August 1894 (reprinted in <i>My First Book</i> volume and in a 
late volume of the <i>Edinburgh Edition</i>) has recalled some of
the circumstances connected with this visit of mine to Braemar, 
as it bore on the destination of <i>Treasure Island</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And now, who should come dropping in, <i>ex
machin&acirc;</i>, but Dr Japp, like the disguised prince, who is
to bring down the curtain upon peace and happiness in the last 
act; for he carried in his pocket, not a horn or a talisman, but 
a publisher, in fact, ready to unearth new writers for my old 
friend Mr Henderson&rsquo;s <i>Young Folks</i>.&nbsp; Even the 
ruthlessness of a united family recoiled before the extreme 
measure of inflicting on our guest the mutilated members of 
<i>The Sea-Cook</i>; at the same time, we would by no means stop 
our readings, and accordingly the tale was begun again at the 
beginning, and solemnly redelivered for the benefit of Dr 
Japp.&nbsp; From that moment on, I have thought highly of his 
critical faculty; for when he left us, he carried away the 
manuscript in his portmanteau.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Treasure Island</i>&mdash;it was Mr Henderson who 
deleted the first title, <i>The Sea-Cook</i>&mdash;appeared duly 
in <i>Young Folks</i>, where it figured in the ignoble midst 
without woodcuts, and attracted not the least attention.&nbsp; I 
did not care.&nbsp; I liked the tale myself, for much the same 
reason as my father liked the beginning: it was my kind of 
picturesque.&nbsp; I was not a little proud of John Silver also; 
and to this day rather admire that smooth and formidable 
adventurer.&nbsp; What was infinitely more exhilarating, I had 
passed a landmark.&nbsp; I had finished a tale and written The 
End upon my manuscript, as I had not done since <i>The Pentland 
Rising</i>, when I was a boy of sixteen, not yet at 
college.&nbsp; In truth, it was so by a lucky set of accidents: 
had not Dr Japp come on his visit, had not the tale flowed from 
me with singular ease, it must have been laid aside, like its 
predecessors, and found a circuitous and unlamented way to the 
fire.&nbsp; Purists may suggest it would have been better 
so.&nbsp; I am not of that mind.&nbsp; The tale seems to have 
given much pleasure, and it brought (or was the means of 
bringing) fire, food, and wine to a deserving family in which I 
took an interest.&nbsp; I need scarcely say I mean my 
own.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He himself gives a goodly list of the predecessors which had 
&ldquo;found a circuitous and unlamented way to the 
fire&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As soon as I was able to write, I became a 
good friend to the paper-makers.&nbsp; Reams upon reams must have
gone to the making of <i>Rathillet</i>, <i>The Pentland 
Rising</i>, <i>The King&rsquo;s Pardon</i> (otherwise <i>Park 
Whitehead</i>), <i>Edward Daven</i>, <i>A Country Dance</i>, and 
<i>A Vendetta in the West</i>.&nbsp; <i>Rathillet</i> was 
attempted before fifteen, <i>The Vendetta</i> at twenty-nine, and
the succession of defeats lasted unbroken till I was 
thirty-one.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another thing I carried from Braemar with me which I greatly 
prize&mdash;this was a copy of <i>Christianity confirmed by 
Jewish and Heathen Testimony</i>, by Mr Stevenson&rsquo;s father,
with his autograph signature and many of his own marginal 
notes.&nbsp; He had thought deeply on many 
subjects&mdash;theological, scientific, and social&mdash;and had 
recorded, I am afraid, but the smaller half of his thoughts and 
speculations.&nbsp; Several days in the mornings, before R. L. 
Stevenson was able to face the somewhat &ldquo;snell&rdquo; air 
of the hills, I had long walks with the old gentleman, when we 
also had long talks on many subjects&mdash;the liberalising of 
the Scottish Church, educational reform, etc.; and, on one 
occasion, a statement of his reason, because of the subscription,
for never having become an elder.&nbsp; That he had in some small
measure enjoyed my society, as I certainly had much enjoyed his, 
was borne out by a letter which I received from the son in reply 
to one I had written, saying that surely his father had never 
meant to present me at the last moment on my leaving by coach 
with that volume, with his name on it, and with pencilled notes 
here and there, but had merely given it me to read and 
return.&nbsp; In the circumstances I may perhaps be excused 
quoting from a letter dated Castleton of Braemar, September 1881,
in illustration of what I have said&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Dr 
Japp</span>,&mdash;My father has gone, but I think I may take it 
upon me to ask you to keep the book.&nbsp; Of all things you 
could do to endear yourself to me you have done the best, for, 
from your letter, you have taken a fancy to my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know how to thank you for your kind trouble in
the matter of <i>The Sea-Cook</i>, but I am not unmindful.&nbsp; 
My health is still poorly, and I have added intercostal 
rheumatism&mdash;a new attraction, which sewed me up nearly 
double for two days, and still gives me &lsquo;a list to 
starboard&rsquo;&mdash;let us be ever nautical. . . . I do not 
think with the start I have, there will be any difficulty in 
letting Mr Henderson go ahead whenever he likes.&nbsp; I will 
write my story up to its legitimate conclusion, and then we shall
be in a position to judge whether a sequel would be desirable, 
and I myself would then know better about its practicability from
the story-telling point of view.&mdash;Yours very sincerely, 
<span class="smcap">Robert Louis Stevenson</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little later came the following:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">The Cottage, Castleton of Braemar</span>.<br />
(<i>No date</i>.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Dr 
Japp</span>,&mdash;Herewith go nine chapters.&nbsp; I have been a
little seedy; and the two last that I have written seem to me on 
a false venue; hence the smallness of the batch.&nbsp; I have 
now, I hope, in the three last sent, turned the corner, with no 
great amount of dulness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The map, with all its names, notes, soundings, and 
things, should make, I believe, an admirable advertisement for 
the story.&nbsp; Eh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you got a telegram and letter I forwarded after 
you to Dinnat.&mdash;Believe me, yours very sincerely, <span 
class="smcap">Robert Louis Stevenson</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the afternoon, if fine and dry, we went walking, and 
Stevenson would sometimes tell us stories of his short experience
at the Scottish Bar, and of his first and only brief.&nbsp; I 
remember him contrasting that with his experiences as an engineer
with Bob Bain, who, as manager, was then superintending the 
building of a breakwater.&nbsp; Of that time, too, he told the 
choicest stories, and especially of how, against all orders, he 
bribed Bob with five shillings to let him go down in the 
diver&rsquo;s dress.&nbsp; He gave us a splendid 
description&mdash;finer, I think, than even that in his 
<i>Memories</i>&mdash;of his sensations on the sea-bottom, which 
seems to have interested him as deeply, and suggested as many 
strange fancies, as anything which he ever came across on the 
surface.&nbsp; But the possibility of enterprises of this sort 
ended&mdash;Stevenson lost his interest in engineering.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

<img alt="Manuscript letter by R.L.S." src="images/p20s.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Stevenson&rsquo;s father had, indeed, been much exercised in 
his day by theological questions and difficulties, and though he 
remained a staunch adherent of the Established Church of Scotland
he knew well and practically what is meant by the term 
&ldquo;accommodation,&rdquo; as it is used by theologians in 
reference to creeds and formulas; for he had over and over again,
because of the strict character of the subscription required from
elders of the Scottish Church declined, as I have said, to accept
the office.&nbsp; In a very express sense you could see that he 
bore the marks of his past in many ways&mdash;a quick, sensitive,
in some ways even a fantastic-minded man, yet with a strange 
solidity and common-sense amid it all, just as though ferns with 
the veritable fairies&rsquo; seed were to grow out of a common 
stone wall.&nbsp; He looked like a man who had not been without 
sleepless nights&mdash;without troubles, sorrows, and 
perplexities, and even yet, had not wholly risen above some of 
them, or the results of them.&nbsp; His voice was &ldquo;low and 
sweet&rdquo;&mdash;with just a possibility in it of rising to a 
shrillish key.&nbsp; A sincere and faithful man, who had walked 
very demurely through life, though with a touch of sudden, 
bright, quiet humour and fancy, every now and then crossing the 
grey of his characteristic pensiveness or melancholy, and drawing
effect from it.&nbsp; He was most frank and genial with me, and I
greatly honour his memory. <a name="citation2"></a><a 
href="#footnote2" class="citation">[2]</a></p>
<p>Thomas Stevenson, with a strange, sad smile, told me how much 
of a disappointment, in the first stage, at all events, Louis (he
always called his son Louis at home), had caused him, by failing 
to follow up his profession at the Scottish Bar.&nbsp; How much 
he had looked forward, after the engineering was abandoned, to 
his devoting himself to the work of the Parliament House (as the 
Hall of the Chief Court is called in Scotland, from the building 
having been while yet there was a Scottish Parliament the place 
where it sat), though truly one cannot help feeling how much 
Stevenson&rsquo;s very air and figure would have been out of 
keeping among the bewigged, pushing, sharp-set, hard-featured, 
and even red-faced and red-nosed (some of them, at any rate) 
company, who daily walked the Parliament House, and talked and 
gossiped there, often of other things than law and equity.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Well, yes, perhaps it was all for the best,&rdquo; he 
said, with a sigh, on my having interjected the remark that R. L.
Stevenson was wielding far more influence than he ever could have
done as a Scottish counsel, even though he had risen rapidly in 
his profession, and become Lord-Advocate or even a judge.</p>
<p>There was, indeed, a very pathetic kind of harking back on the
might-have-beens when I talked with him on this subject.&nbsp; He
had reconciled himself in a way to the inevitable, and, like a 
sensible man, was now inclined to make the most and the best of 
it.&nbsp; The marriage, which, on the report of it, had been but 
a new disappointment to him, had, as if by magic, been 
transformed into a blessing in his mind and his wife&rsquo;s by 
personal contact with Fanny Van der Griff Stevenson, which no one
who ever met her could wonder at; but, nevertheless, his dream of
seeing his only son walking in the pathways of the Stevensons, 
and adorning a profession in Edinburgh, and so winning new and 
welcome laurels for the family and the name, was still present 
with him constantly, and by contrast, he was depressed with 
contemplation of the real state of the case, when, as I have 
said, I pointed out to him, as more than once I did, what an 
influence his son was wielding now, not only over those near to 
him, but throughout the world, compared with what could have come
to him as a lighthouse engineer, however successful, or it may be
as a briefless advocate or barrister, walking, hardly in glory 
and in joy, the Hall of the Edinburgh Parliament House.&nbsp; And
when I pictured the yet greater influence that was sure to come 
to him, he only shook his head with that smile which tells of 
hopes long-cherished and lost at last, and of resignation gained,
as though at stern duty&rsquo;s call and an honest desire for the
good of those near and dear to him.&nbsp; It moved me more than I
can say, and always in the midst of it he adroitly, and somewhat 
abruptly, changed the subject.&nbsp; Such penalties do parents 
often pay for the honour of giving geniuses to the world.&nbsp; 
Here, again, it may be true, &ldquo;the individual withers but 
the world is more and more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The impression of a kind of tragic fatality was but added to 
when Stevenson would speak of his father in such terms of love 
and admiration as quite moved one, of his desire to please him, 
of his highest respect and gratitude to him, and pride in having 
such a father.&nbsp; It was most characteristic that when, in his
travels in America, he met a gentleman who expressed plainly his 
keen disappointment on learning that he had but been introduced 
to the son and not to the father&mdash;to the as yet but budding 
author&mdash;and not to the builder of the great lighthouse 
beacons that constantly saved mariners from shipwreck round many 
stormy coasts, he should record the incident, as his readers will
remember, with such a strange mixture of a pride and filial 
gratitude, and half humorous humiliation.&nbsp; Such is the 
penalty a son of genius often pays in heart-throbs for the 
inability to do aught else but follow his destiny&mdash;follow 
his star, even though as Dante says:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Se tu segui tua stella<br />
Non puoi fallire a glorioso porto.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation3"></a><a href="#footnote3" 
class="citation">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What added a keen thrill as of quivering flesh exposed, was 
that Thomas Stevenson on one side was exactly the man to 
appreciate such attainments and work in another, and I often 
wondered how far the sense of Edinburgh propriety and worldly 
estimates did weigh with him here.</p>
<p>Mr Stevenson mentioned to me a peculiar fact which has since 
been noted by his son, that, notwithstanding the kind of work he 
had so successfully engaged in, he was no mathematician, and had 
to submit his calculations to another to be worked out in 
definite mathematical formul&aelig;.&nbsp; Thomas Stevenson gave 
one the impression of a remarkably sweet, great personality, 
grave, anxious, almost morbidly forecasting, yet full of 
childlike hope and ready affection, but, perhaps, so earnestly 
taken up with some points as to exaggerate their importance and 
be too self-conscious and easily offended in respect to 
them.&nbsp; But there was no affectation in him.&nbsp; He was 
simple-minded, sincere to the core; most kindly, homely, 
hospitable, much intent on brotherly offices.&nbsp; He had the 
Scottish <i>perfervidum</i> too&mdash;he could tolerate nothing 
mean or creeping; and his eye would lighten and glance in a 
striking manner when such was spoken of.&nbsp; I have since heard
that his charities were very extensive, and dispensed in the most
hidden and secret ways.&nbsp; He acted here on the Scripture 
direction, &ldquo;Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand 
doeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was much exercised when I saw him about 
some defects, as he held, in the methods of Scotch education (for
he was a true lover of youth, and cared more for character being 
formed than for heads being merely crammed).&nbsp; Sagacious, 
with fine forecast, with a high ideal, and yet up to a certain 
point a most tolerant temper, he was a fine specimen of the 
Scottish gentleman.&nbsp; His son tells that, as he was engaged 
in work calculated to benefit the world and to save life, he 
would not for long take out a patent for his inventions, and thus
lost immense sums.&nbsp; I can well believe that: it seems quite 
in keeping with my impressions of the man.&nbsp; There was 
nothing stolid or selfishly absorbed in him.&nbsp; He bore the 
marks of deep, true, honest feeling, true benevolence, and 
open-handed generosity, and despite the son&rsquo;s great 
pen-craft, and inventive power, would have forgiven my saying 
that sometimes I have had a doubt whether the father was not, 
after all, the greater man of the two, though certainly not, like
the hero of <i>In Memoriam</i>, moulded &ldquo;in colossal 
calm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In theological matters, in which Thomas Stevenson had been 
much and deeply exercised, he held very strong views, leading 
decisively to ultra-Calvinism; but, as I myself could well 
sympathise with such views, if I did not hold them, knowing well 
the strange ways in which they had gone to form grand, if 
sometimes sternly forbidding characters, there were no 
cross-purposes as there might have been with some on that 
subject.&nbsp; And always I felt I had an original character and 
a most interesting one to study.</p>
<p>This is another very characteristic letter to me from Davos 
Platz:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Chalet Buol</span>, 
<span class="smcap">Davos</span>, <span

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Dr Japp</span>,&mdash;You 
must think me a forgetful rogue, as indeed I am; for I have but 
now told my publisher to send you a copy of the <i>Familiar 
Studies</i>.&nbsp; However, I own I have delayed this letter till
I could send you the enclosed.&nbsp; Remembering the night at 
Braemar, when we visited the picture-gallery, I hoped they might 
amuse you.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see we do some publishing hereaway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With kind regards, believe me, always yours 
faithfully,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert Louis Stevenson</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall hope to see you in town in May.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The enclosed was the second series of <i>Moral Emblems</i>, by
R. L. Stevenson, printed by Samuel Osbourne.&nbsp; My answer to 
this letter brought the following:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">Chalet-Buol</span>, <span 
class="smcap">Davos</span>,<br />
<i>April</i> 1<i>st</i>, 1882.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Dr Japp</span>,&mdash;A 
good day to date this letter, which is, in fact, a confession of 
incapacity.&nbsp; During my wife&rsquo;s wretched 
illness&mdash;or I should say the worst of it, for she is not yet
rightly well&mdash;I somewhat lost my head, and entirely lost a 
great quire of corrected proofs.&nbsp; This is one of the 
results: I hope there are none more serious.&nbsp; I was never so
sick of any volume as I was of that; I was continually receiving 
fresh proofs with fresh infinitesimal difficulties.&nbsp; I was 
ill; I did really fear, for my wife was worse than ill.&nbsp; 
Well, &rsquo;tis out now; and though I have already observed 
several carelessnesses myself, and now here is another of your 
finding&mdash;of which indeed, I ought to be ashamed&mdash;it 
will only justify the sweeping humility of the preface.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Symonds was actually dining with us when your letter 
came, and I communicated your remarks, which pleased him.&nbsp; 
He is a far better and more interesting thing than his books.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The elephant was my wife&rsquo;s, so she is 
proportionately elate you should have picked it out for praise 
from a collection, let us add, so replete with the highest 
qualities of art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wicked carcass, as John Knox calls it, holds 
together wonderfully.&nbsp; In addition to many other things, and
a volume of travel, I find I have written since December ninety 
Cornhill pp. of Magazine work&mdash;essays and 
stories&mdash;40,000 words; and I am none the worse&mdash;I am 
better.&nbsp; I begin to hope I may, if not outlive this 
wolverine upon my shoulders, at least carry him bravely like 
Symonds or Alexander Pope.&nbsp; I begin to take a pride in that 
hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be much interested to see your criticisms: you 
might perhaps send them on to me.&nbsp; I believe you know that I
am not dangerous&mdash;one folly I have not&mdash;I am not touchy
under criticism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam and my wife both beg to be remembered, and Sam also
sends as a present a work of his own.&mdash;Yours very 
sincerely,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Robert Louis Stevenson</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As indicating the estimate of many of the good Edinburgh 
people of Stevenson and the Stevensons that still held sway up to
so late a date as 1893, I will here extract two characteristic 
passages from the letters of the friend and correspondent of 
these days just referred to, and to whom I had sent a copy of the
<i>Atalanta</i> Magazine, with an article of mine on 
Stevenson.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If you can excuse the garrulity of age, I 
can tell you one or two things about Louis Stevenson, his father 
and even his grandfather, which you may work up some other day, 
as you have so deftly embedded in the <i>Atalanta</i> article 
that small remark on his acting.&nbsp; Your paper is pleasant and
modest: most of R. L. Stevenson&rsquo;s admirers are inclined to 
lay it on far too thick.&nbsp; That he is a genius we all admit; 
but his genius, if fine, is limited.&nbsp; For example, he cannot
paint (or at least he never has painted) a woman.&nbsp; No more 
could Fettes Douglas, skilful artist though he was in his own 
special line, and I shall tell you a remark of Russel&rsquo;s 
thereon some day. <a name="citation4"></a><a href="#footnote4" 
class="citation">[4]</a>&nbsp; There are women in his books, but 
there is none of the beauty and subtlety of womanhood in 
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;R. L. Stevenson I knew well as a lad and often met him 
and talked with him.&nbsp; He acted in private theatricals got up
by the late Professor Fleeming Jenkin.&nbsp; But he had then, as 
always, a pretty guid conceit o&rsquo; himsel&rsquo;&mdash;which 
his clique have done nothing to check.&nbsp; His father and his 
grandfather (I have danced with his mother before her marriage) I
knew better; but &lsquo;the family theologian,&rsquo; as some of 
R. L. Stevenson&rsquo;s friends dabbed his father, was a very 
touchy theologian, and denounced any one who in the least 
differed from his extreme Calvinistic views.&nbsp; I came under 
his lash most unwittingly in this way myself.&nbsp; But for this 
twist, he was a good fellow&mdash;kind and hospitable&mdash;and a
really able man in his profession.&nbsp; His father-in-law, R. L.
Stevenson&rsquo;s maternal grandfather, was the Rev. Dr Balfour, 
minister of Colinton&mdash;one of the finest-looking old men I 
ever saw&mdash;tall, upright, and ruddy at eighty.&nbsp; But he 
was marvellously feeble as a preacher, and often said things that
were deliciously, unconsciously, unintentionally laughable, if 
not witty.&nbsp; We were near Colinton for some years; and Mr 
Russell (of the <i>Scotsman</i>), who once attended the Parish 
Church with us, was greatly tickled by Balfour discoursing on the
story of Joseph and Potiphar&rsquo;s wife, remarking that Mrs 
P---&rsquo;s conduct was &lsquo;highly 
improper&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The estimate of R. L. Stevenson was not and could not be final
in this case, for <i>Weir of Hermiston</i> and <i>Catriona</i> 
were yet unwritten, not to speak of others, but the passages 
reflect a certain side of Edinburgh opinion, illustrating the old
Scripture doctrine that a prophet has honour everywhere but in 
his own country.&nbsp; And the passages themselves bear evidence 
that I violate no confidence then, for they were given to me to 
be worked into any after-effort I might make on Stevenson.&nbsp; 
My friend was a good and an acute critic who had done some 
acceptable literary work in his day.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER III&mdash;THE CHILD FATHER OF THE MAN</h2>
<p>R. L. Stevenson was born on 13th November 1850, the very year 
of the death of his grandfather, Robert Stevenson, whom he has so
finely celebrated.&nbsp; As a mere child he gave token of his 
character.&nbsp; As soon as he could read, he was keen for books,
and, before very long, had read all the story-books he could lay 
hands on; and, when the stock ran out, he would go and look in at
all the shop windows within reach, and try to piece out the 
stories from the bits exposed in open pages and the woodcuts.</p>
<p>He had a nurse of very remarkable character&mdash;evidently a 
paragon&mdash;who deeply influenced him and did much to form his 
young mind&mdash;Alison Cunningham, who, in his juvenile lingo, 
became &ldquo;Cumy,&rdquo; and who not only was never forgotten, 
but to the end was treated as his &ldquo;second 
mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; In his dedication of his <i>Child&rsquo;s 
Garden of Verses</i> to her, he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My second mother, my first wife,<br />
The angel of my infant life.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Her copy of <i>Kidnapped</i> was inscribed to her by the hand 
of Stevenson, thus:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span 
class="smcap">To Cumy</span>, <span class="smcap">from her 
boy</span>, <span class="smcap">the author</span>.<br />
<span class="smcap">Skerryvore</span>, 18<i>th</i> <i>July</i> 
1888.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Skerryvore was the name of Stevenson&rsquo;s Bournemouth home,
so named after one of the Stevenson lighthouses.&nbsp; His first 
volume, <i>An Inland Voyage</i> has this pretty dedication, 
inscribed in a neat, small hand:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear 
Cumy</span>,&mdash;If you had not taken so much trouble with me 
all the years of my childhood, this little book would never have 
been written.&nbsp; Many a long night you sat up with me when I 
was ill.&nbsp; I wish I could hope, by way of return, to amuse a 
single evening for you with my little book.&nbsp; But whatever 
you think of it, I know you will think kindly of</p>
<p><span class="smcap">The Author</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Cumy&rdquo; was perhaps the most influential teacher 
Stevenson had.&nbsp; What she and his mother taught took effect 
and abode with him, which was hardly the case with any other of 
his teachers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In contrast to Goethe,&rdquo; says Mr 
Baildon, &ldquo;Stevenson was but little affected by his 
relations to women, and, when this point is fully gone into, it 
will probably be found that his mother and nurse in childhood, 
and his wife and step-daughter in later life, are about the only 
women who seriously influenced either his character or his 
art.&rdquo; (p. 32).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Mr Kelman is celebrating Stevenson for the consistency 
and continuity of his undogmatic religion, he is almost 
throughout celebrating &ldquo;Cumy&rdquo; and her influence, 
though unconsciously.&nbsp; Here, again, we have an apt and yet 
more striking illustration, after that of the good Lord 
Shaftesbury and many others, of the deep and lasting effect a 
good and earnest woman, of whom the world may never hear, may 
have had upon a youngster of whom all the world shall hear.&nbsp;
When Mr Kelman says that &ldquo;the religious element in 
Stevenson was not a thing of late growth, but an integral part 
and vital interest of his life,&rdquo; he but points us back to 
the earlier religious influences to which he had been effectually
subject.&nbsp; &ldquo;His faith was not for himself alone, and 
the phases of Christianity which it has asserted are peculiarly 
suited to the spiritual needs of many in the present 
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We should not lay so much weight as Mr Kelman does on the mere
number of times &ldquo;the Divine name&rdquo; is found in 
Stevenson&rsquo;s writings, but there is something in such 
confessions as the following to his father, when he was, amid 
hardship and illness, in Paris in 1878:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Still I believe in myself and my fellow-men
and the God who made us all. . . . I am lonely and sick and out 
of heart.&nbsp; Well, I still hope; I still believe; I still see 
the good in the inch, and cling to it.&nbsp; It is not much, 
perhaps, but it is always something.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, &ldquo;Cumy&rdquo; was a very effective teacher, whose 
influence and teaching long remained.&nbsp; His other teachers, 
however famous and highly gifted, did not attain to such success 
with him.&nbsp; And because of this non-success they blamed him, 
as is usual.&nbsp; He was fond of playing truant&mdash;declared, 
indeed, that he was about as methodic a truant as ever could have
existed.&nbsp; He much loved to go on long wanderings by himself 
on the Pentland Hills and read about the Covenanters, and while 
yet a youth of sixteen he wrote <i>The Pentland 
Rising</i>&mdash;a pamphlet in size and a piece of fine 
work&mdash;which was duly published, is now scarce, and fetches a
high price.&nbsp; He had made himself thoroughly familiar with 
all the odd old corners of Edinburgh&mdash;John Knox&rsquo;s 
haunts and so on, all which he has turned to account in essays, 
descriptions and in stories&mdash;especially in 
<i>Catriona</i>.&nbsp; When a mere youth at school, as he tells 
us himself, he had little or no desire to carry off prizes and do
just as other boys did; he was always wishing to observe, and to 
see, and try things for himself&mdash;was, in fact, in the eyes 
of schoolmasters and tutors something of an <i>idler</i>, with 
splendid gifts which he would not rightly apply.&nbsp; He was 
applying them rightly, though not in their way.&nbsp; It is not 
only in his <i>Apology for Idlers</i> that this confession is 
made, but elsewhere, as in his essay on <i>A College 
Magazine</i>, where he says, &ldquo;I was always busy on my own 
private end, which was to learn to write.&nbsp; I kept always two
books in my pocket, one to read and one to write in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he went to College it was still the same&mdash;he tells 
us in the funniest way how he managed to wheedle a certificate 
for Greek out of Professor Blackie, though the Professor owned 
&ldquo;his face was not familiar to him&rdquo;!&nbsp; He fared 
very differently when, afterwards his father, eager that he 
should follow his profession, got him to enter the civil 
engineering class under Professor Fleeming Jenkin.&nbsp; He still
stuck to his old courses&mdash;wandering about, and, in sheltered
corners, writing in the open air, and was not present in class 
more than a dozen times.&nbsp; When the session was ended he went
up to try for a certificate from Fleeming Jenkin.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;No, no, Mr Stevenson,&rdquo; said the Professor; &ldquo;I 
might give it in a doubtful case, but yours is not doubtful: you 
have not kept my classes.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the most 
characteristic thing&mdash;honourable to both men&mdash;is to 
come; for this was the beginning of a friendship which grew and 
strengthened and is finally celebrated in the younger man&rsquo;s
sketch of the elder.&nbsp; He learned from Professor Fleeming 
Jenkin, perhaps unconsciously, more of the <i>humaniores</i>, 
than consciously he did of engineering.&nbsp; A friend of mine, 
who knew well both the Stevenson family and the Balfours, to 
which R. L. Stevenson&rsquo;s mother belonged, recalls, as we 
have seen, his acting in the private theatricals that were got up
by the Professor, and adds, &ldquo;He was then a very handsome 
fellow, and looked splendidly as Sir Charles Pomander, and 
essayed, not wholly without success, Sir Peter Teazle,&rdquo; 
which one can well believe, no less than that he acted such parts
splendidly as well as looked them.</p>
<p><i>Longman&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, immediately after his death, 
published the following poem, which took a very pathetic touch 
from the circumstances of its appearance&mdash;the more that, 
while it imaginatively and finely commemorated these days of 
truant wanderings, it showed the ruling passion for home and the 
old haunts, strongly and vividly, even not unnigh to death:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The tropics vanish, and meseems that I,<br 
/>
From Halkerside, from topmost Allermuir,<br />
Or steep Caerketton, dreaming gaze again.<br />
Far set in fields and woods, the town I see<br />
Spring gallant from the shallows of her smoke,<br />
Cragg&rsquo;d, spired, and turreted, her virgin fort<br />
Beflagg&rsquo;d.&nbsp; About, on seaward drooping hills,<br />
New folds of city glitter.&nbsp; Last, the Forth<br />
Wheels ample waters set with sacred isles,<br />
And populous Fife smokes with a score of towns,<br />
There, on the sunny frontage of a hill,<br />
Hard by the house of kings, repose the dead,<br />
My dead, the ready and the strong of word.<br />
Their works, the salt-encrusted, still survive;<br />
The sea bombards their founded towers; the night<br />
Thrills pierced with their strong lamps.&nbsp; The artificers,<br
/>
One after one, here in this grated cell,<br />
Where the rain erases and the rust consumes,<br />
Fell upon lasting silence.&nbsp; Continents<br />
And continental oceans intervene;<br />
A sea uncharted, on a lampless isle,<br />
Environs and confines their wandering child<br />
In vain.&nbsp; The voice of generations dead<br />
Summons me, sitting distant, to arise,<br />
My numerous footsteps nimbly to retrace,<br />
And all mutation over, stretch me down<br />
In that denoted city of the dead.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER IV&mdash;HEREDITY ILLUSTRATED</h2>
<p>At first sight it would seem hard to trace any illustration of
the doctrine of heredity in the case of this master of 
romance.&nbsp; George Eliot&rsquo;s dictum that we are, each one 
of us, but an omnibus carrying down the traits of our ancestors, 
does not appear at all to hold here.&nbsp; This fanciful realist,
this n&auml;ive-wistful humorist, this dreamy mystical casuist, 
crossed by the innocent bohemian, this serious and genial 
essayist, in whom the deep thought was hidden by the gracious 
play of wit and phantasy, came, on the father&rsquo;s side, of a 
stock of what the world regarded as a quiet, ingenious, demure, 
practical, home-keeping people.&nbsp; In his rich colour, 
originality, and graceful air, it is almost as though the bloom 
of japonica came on a rich old orchard apple-tree, all out of 
season too.&nbsp; Those who go hard on heredity would say, 
perhaps, that he was the result of some strange 
back-stroke.&nbsp; But, on closer examination, we need not go so 
far.&nbsp; His grandfather, Robert Stevenson, the great 
lighthouse-builder, the man who reared the iron-bound pillar on 
the destructive Bell Rock, and set life-saving lights there, was 
very intent on his professional work, yet he had his ideal, and 
romantic, and adventurous side.&nbsp; In the delightful sketch 
which his famous grandson gave of him, does he not tell of the 
joy Robert Stevenson had on the annual voyage in the 
<i>Lighthouse Yacht</i>&mdash;how it was looked forward to, 
yearned for, and how, when he had Walter Scott on board, his fund
of story and reminiscence all through the tour never 
failed&mdash;how Scott drew upon it in <i>The Pirate</i> and the 
notes to <i>The Pirate</i>, and with what pride Robert Stevenson 
preserved the lines Scott wrote in the lighthouse album at the 
Bell Rock on that occasion:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;PHAROS LOQUITUR</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far in the bosom of the deep<br />
O&rsquo;er these wild shelves my watch I keep,<br />
A ruddy gem of changeful light<br />
Bound on the dusky brow of night.<br />
The seaman bids my lustre hail,<br />
And scorns to strike his timorous sail.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And how in 1850 the old man, drawing nigh unto death, was with
the utmost difficulty dissuaded from going the voyage once more, 
and was found furtively in his room packing his portmanteau in 
spite of the protests of all his family, and would have gone but 
for the utter weakness of death.</p>
<p>His father was also a splendid engineer; was full of invention
and devoted to his profession, but he, too, was not without his 
romances, and even vagaries.&nbsp; He loved a story, was a fine 
teller of stories, used to sit at night and spin the most 
wondrous yarns, a man of much reserve, yet also of much power in 
discourse, with an aptness and felicity in the use of 
phrases&mdash;so much so, as his son tells, that on his deathbed,
when his power of speech was passing from him, and he 
couldn&rsquo;t articulate the right word, he was silent rather 
than use the wrong one.&nbsp; I shall never forget how in these 
early morning walks at Braemar, finding me sympathetic, he unbent
with the air of a man who had unexpectedly found something he had
sought, and was fairly confidential.</p>
<p>On the mother&rsquo;s side our author came of ministers.&nbsp;
His maternal grandfather, the Rev. Dr Balfour of Colinton, was a 
man of handsome presence, tall, venerable-looking, and not 
without a mingled authority and humour of his own&mdash;no very 
great preacher, I have heard, but would sometimes bring a smile 
to the faces of his hearers by very na&iuml;ve and original ways 
of putting things.&nbsp; R. L. Stevenson quaintly tells a story 
of how his grandfather when he had physic to take, and was 
indulged in a sweet afterwards, yet would not allow the child to 
have a sweet because he had not had the physic.&nbsp; A veritable
Calvinist in daily action&mdash;from him, no doubt, our subject 
drew much of his interest in certain directions&mdash;John Knox, 
Scottish history, the &rsquo;15 and the &rsquo;45, and no doubt 
much that justifies the line &ldquo;something of 
shorter-catechist,&rdquo; as applied by Henley to Stevenson among
very contrasted traits indeed.</p>
<p>But strange truly are the interblendings of race, and the way 
in which traits of ancestors reappear, modifying and transforming
each other.&nbsp; The gardener knows what can be done by grafts 
and buddings; but more wonderful far than anything there, are the
mysterious blendings and outbursts of what is old and forgotten, 
along with what is wholly new and strange, and all going to 
produce often what we call sometimes eccentricity, and sometimes 
originality and genius.</p>
<p>Mr J. F. George, in <i>Scottish Notes and Queries</i>, wrote 
as follows on Stevenson&rsquo;s inheritances and indebtedness to 
certain of his ancestors:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;About 1650, James Balfour, one of the 
Principal Clerks of the Court of Session, married Bridget, 
daughter of Chalmers of Balbaithan, Keithhall, and that estate 
was for some time in the name of Balfour.&nbsp; His son, James 
Balfour of Balbaithan, Merchant and Magistrate of Edinburgh, paid
poll-tax in 1696, but by 1699 the land had been sold.&nbsp; This 
was probably due to the fact that Balfour was one of the 
Governors of the Darien Company.&nbsp; His grandson, James 
Balfour of Pilrig (1705-1795), sometime Professor of Moral 
Philosophy in Edinburgh University, whose portrait is sketched in
<i>Catriona</i>, also made a Garioch [Aberdeenshire district] 
marriage, his wife being Cecilia, fifth daughter of Sir John 
Elphinstone, second baronet of Logie (Elphinstone) and Sheriff of
Aberdeen, by Mary, daughter of Sir Gilbert Elliot, first baronet 
of Minto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Referring to the Minto descent, Stevenson claims to 
have &lsquo;shaken a spear in the Debatable Land and shouted the 
slogan of the Elliots.&rsquo;&nbsp; He evidently knew little or 
nothing of his relations on the Elphinstone side.&nbsp; The Logie
Elphinstones were a cadet branch of Glack, an estate acquired by 
Nicholas Elphinstone in 1499.&nbsp; William Elphinstone, a 
younger son of James of Glack, and Elizabeth Wood of Bonnyton, 
married Margaret Forbes, and was father of Sir James Elphinstone,
Bart., of Logie, so created in 1701. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stevenson would have been delighted to acknowledge his 
relationship, remote though it was, to &lsquo;the Wolf of 
Badenoch,&rsquo; who burned Elgin Cathedral without the Earl of 
Kildare&rsquo;s excuse that he thought the Bishop was in it; and 
to the Wolf&rsquo;s son, the Victor of Harlaw [and] to his nephew
&lsquo;John O&rsquo;Coull,&rsquo; Constable of France. . . . Also
among Tusitala&rsquo;s kin may be noted, in addition to the later
Gordons of Gight, the Tiger Earl of Crawford, familiarly known as
&lsquo;Earl Beardie,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Wicked Master&rsquo; of 
the same line, who was fatally stabbed by a Dundee cobbler 
&lsquo;for taking a stoup of drink from him&rsquo;; Lady Jean 
Lindsay, who ran away with &lsquo;a common jockey with the 
horn,&rsquo; and latterly became a beggar; David Lindsay, the 
last Laird of Edzell [a lichtsome Lindsay fallen on evil days], 
who ended his days as hostler at a Kirkwall inn, and 
&lsquo;Mussel Mou&rsquo;ed Charlie,&rsquo; the Jacobite 
ballad-singer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stevenson always believed that he had a strong 
spiritual affinity to Robert Fergusson.&nbsp; It is more than 
probable that there was a distant maternal affinity as 
well.&nbsp; Margaret Forbes, the mother of Sir James Elphinstone,
the purchaser of Logie, has not been identified, but it is 
probable she was of the branch of the Tolquhon Forbeses who 
previously owned Logie.&nbsp; Fergusson&rsquo;s mother, Elizabeth
Forbes, was the daughter of a Kildrummy tacksman, who by constant
tradition is stated to have been of the house of Tolquhon.&nbsp; 
It would certainly be interesting if this suggested connection 
could be proved.&rdquo; <a name="citation5"></a><a 
href="#footnote5" class="citation">[5]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;From his Highland ancestors,&rdquo; says the 
<i>Quarterly Review</i>, &ldquo;Louis drew the strain of Celtic 
melancholy with all its perils and possibilities, and its 
kinship, to the mood of day-dreaming, which has flung over so 
many of his pages now the vivid light wherein figures imagined 
grew as real as flesh and blood, and yet, again, the ghostly, 
strange, lonesome, and stinging mist under whose spell we see the
world bewitched, and every object quickens with a throb of 
infectious terror.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, as in many other cases, we see how the traits of 
ancestry reappear and transform other strains, strangely the more
remote often being the strongest and most persistent and 
wonderful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is through his father, strange as it may 
seem,&rdquo; says Mr Baildon, &ldquo;that Stevenson gets the 
Celtic elements so marked in his person, character, and genius; 
for his father&rsquo;s pedigree runs back to the Highland clan 
Macgregor, the kin of Rob Roy.&nbsp; Stevenson thus drew in 
Celtic strains from both sides&mdash;from the Balfours and the 
Stevensons alike&mdash;and in his strange, dreamy, beautiful, and
often far-removed fancies we have the finest and most effective 
witness of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr William Archer, in his own characteristic way, has brought 
the inheritances from the two sides of the house into more direct
contact and contrast in an article he wrote in <i>The Daily 
Chronicle</i> on the appearance of the <i>Letters to Family and 
Friends</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;These letters show,&rdquo; he says, 
&ldquo;that Stevenson&rsquo;s was not one of those sunflower 
temperaments which turn by instinct, not effort, towards the 
light, and are, as Mr Francis Thompson puts it, &lsquo;heartless 
and happy, lackeying their god.&rsquo;&nbsp; The strains of his 
heredity were very curiously, but very clearly, mingled.&nbsp; It
may surprise some readers to find him speaking of &lsquo;the 
family evil, despondency,&rsquo; but he spoke with 
knowledge.&nbsp; He inherited from his father not only a stern 
Scottish intentness on the moral aspect of life (&lsquo;I would 
rise from the dead to preach&rsquo;), but a marked disposition to
melancholy and hypochondria.&nbsp; From his mother, on the other 
hand, he derived, along with his physical frailty, a resolute and
cheery stoicism.&nbsp; These two elements in his nature fought 
many a hard fight, and the besieging forces from 
without&mdash;ill-health, poverty, and at one time family 
dissensions&mdash;were by no means without allies in the inner 
citadel of his soul.&nbsp; His spirit was courageous in the 
truest sense of the word: by effort and conviction, not by 
temperamental insensibility to fear.&nbsp; It is clear that there
was a period in his life (and that before the worst of his bodily
ills came upon him) when he was often within measurable distance 
of Carlylean gloom.&nbsp; He was twenty-four when he wrote thus, 
from Swanston, to Mrs Sitwell:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;It is warmer a bit; but my body is most 
decrepit, and I can just manage to be cheery and tread down 
hypochondria under foot by work.&nbsp; I lead such a funny life, 
utterly without interest or pleasure outside of my work: nothing,
indeed, but work all day long, except a short walk alone on the 
cold hills, and meals, and a couple of pipes with my father in 
the evening.&nbsp; It is surprising how it suits me, and how 
happy I keep.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the serenity which arises, not from the absence
of fuliginous elements in the character, but from a potent 
smoke-consuming faculty, and an inflexible will to use it.&nbsp; 
Nine years later he thus admonishes his backsliding parent:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;<span class="smcap">My dear 
Mother</span>,&mdash;I give my father up.&nbsp; I give him a 
parable: that the Waverley novels are better reading for every 
day than the tragic <i>Life</i>.&nbsp; And he takes it back-side 
foremost, and shakes his head, and is gloomier than ever.&nbsp; 
Tell him that I give him up.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want no such a 
parent.&nbsp; This is not the man for my money.&nbsp; I do not 
call that by the name of religion which fills a man with 
bile.&nbsp; I write him a whole letter, bidding him beware of 
extremes, and telling him that his gloom is gallows-worthy; and I
get back an answer&mdash;.&nbsp; Perish the thought of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Here am I on the threshold of another year, 
when, according to all human foresight, I should long ago have 
been resolved into my elements: here am I, who you were persuaded
was born to disgrace you&mdash;and, I will do you the justice to 
add, on no such insufficient grounds&mdash;no very burning 
discredit when all is done; here am I married, and the marriage 
recognised to be a blessing of the first order.&nbsp; A1 at 
Lloyd&rsquo;s.&nbsp; There is he, at his not first youth, able to
take more exercise than I at thirty-three, and gaining a 
stone&rsquo;s weight, a thing of which I am incapable.&nbsp; 
There are you; has the man no gratitude? . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Even the Shorter Catechism, not the merriest 
epitome of religion, and a work exactly as pious although not 
quite so true as the multiplication table&mdash;even that 
dry-as-dust epitome begins with a heroic note.&nbsp; What is 
man&rsquo;s chief end?&nbsp; Let him study that; and ask himself 
if to refuse to enjoy God&rsquo;s kindest gifts is in the spirit 
indicated.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As may be judged from this half-playful, half-serious 
remonstrance, Stevenson&rsquo;s relation to his parents was 
eminently human and beautiful.&nbsp; The family dissensions above
alluded to belonged only to a short but painful period, when the 
father could not reconcile himself to the discovery that the son 
had ceased to accept the formulas of Scottish Calvinism.&nbsp; In
the eyes of the older man such heterodoxy was for the moment 
indistinguishable from atheism; but he soon arrived at a better 
understanding of his son&rsquo;s position.&nbsp; Nothing appears 
more unmistakably in these letters than the ingrained theism of 
Stevenson&rsquo;s way of thought.&nbsp; The poet, the romancer 
within him, revolted from the conception of formless force.&nbsp;
A personal deity was a necessary character in the drama, as he 
conceived it.&nbsp; And his morality, though (or inasmuch as) it 
dwelt more on positive kindness than on negative lawlessness, 
was, as he often insisted, very much akin to the morality of the 
New Testament.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Anyway it is clear that much in the interminglings of blood we
<i>can</i> trace, may go to account for not a little in 
Stevenson.&nbsp; His peculiar interest in the enormities of 
old-time feuds, the excesses, the jealousies, the queer 
psychological puzzles, the desire to work on the outlying and 
morbid, and even the unallowed and unhallowed, for purposes of 
romance&mdash;the delight in dealing with revelations of 
primitive feeling and the out-bursts of the mere natural man 
always strangely checked and diverted by the uprise of other 
tendencies to the dreamy, impalpable, vague, weird and 
horrible.&nbsp; There was the undoubted Celtic element in him 
underlying what seemed foreign to it, the disregard of 
conventionality in one phase, and the falling under it in 
another&mdash;the reaction and the retreat from what had 
attracted and interested him, and then the return upon it, as 
with added zest because of the retreat.&nbsp; The confessed 
Hedonist, enjoying life and boasting of it just a little, and yet
the Puritan in him, as it were, all the time eyeing himself as 
from some loophole of retreat, and then commenting on his own 
behaviour as a Hedonist and Bohemian.&nbsp; This clearly was not 
what most struck Beerbohm Tree, during the time he was in close 
contact with Stevenson, while arranging the production of <i>Beau
Austin</i> at the Haymarket Theatre, for he sees, or confesses to
seeing, only one side, and that the most assertive, and in a 
sense, unreal one:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Stevenson,&rdquo; says Mr Tree, 
&ldquo;always seemed to me an epicure in life.&nbsp; He was 
always intent on extracting the last drop of honey from every 
flower that came in his way.&nbsp; He was absorbed in the 
business of the moment, however trivial.&nbsp; As a companion, he
was delightfully witty; as a personality, as much a creature of 
romance as his own creations.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is simple, and it looks sincere; but it does not touch 
&rsquo;tother side, or hint at, not to say, solve the problem of 
Stevenson&rsquo;s personality.&nbsp; Had he been the mere 
Hedonist he could never have done the work he did.&nbsp; Mr 
Beerbohm Tree certainly did not there see far or all round.</p>
<p>Miss Simpson says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr Henley recalls him to Edinburgh folk as 
he was and as the true Stevenson would have wished to be 
known&mdash;a queer, inexplicable creature, his Celtic blood 
showing like a vein of unknown metal in the stolid, steady rock 
of his sure-founded Stevensonian pedigree.&nbsp; His cousin and 
model, &lsquo;Bob&rsquo; Stevenson, the art critic, showed that 
this foreign element came from the men who lit our guiding lights
for seamen, not from the gentle-blooded Balfours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Henley is right in saying that the gifted boy had 
not much humour.&nbsp; When the joke was against himself he was 
very thin-skinned and had a want of balance.&nbsp; This made him 
feel his honest father&rsquo;s sensible remarks like the sting of
a whip.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miss Simpson then proceeds to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The R. L. Stevenson of old Edinburgh days 
was a conceited, egotistical youth, but a true and honest one: a 
youth full of fire and sentiment, protesting he was 
misunderstood, though he was not.&nbsp; Posing as &lsquo;Velvet 
Coat&rsquo; among the slums, he did no good to himself.&nbsp; He 
had not the Dickens aptitude for depicting the ways of life of 
his adopted friends.&nbsp; When with refined judgment he wanted a
figure for a novel, he went back to the Bar he scorned in his 
callow days and then drew in <i>Weir of Hermiston</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER V&mdash;TRAVELS</h2>
<p>His interest in engineering soon went&mdash;his mind full of 
stories and fancies and human nature.&nbsp; As he had told his 
mother: he did not care about finding what was &ldquo;the strain 
on a bridge,&rdquo; he wanted to know something of human 
beings.</p>
<p>No doubt, much to the disappointment and grief of his father, 
who wished him as an only son to carry on the traditions of the 
family, though he had written two engineering essays of utmost 
promise, the engineering was given up, and he consented to study 
law.&nbsp; He had already contributed to College Magazines, and 
had had even a short spell of editing one; of one of these he has
given a racy account.&nbsp; Very soon after his call to the Bar 
articles and essays from his pen began to appear in 
<i>Macmillan&rsquo;s</i>, and later, more regularly in the 
<i>Cornhill</i>.&nbsp; Careful readers soon began to note here 
the presence of a new force.&nbsp; He had gone on the <i>Inland 
Voyage</i> and an account of it was in hand; and had done that 
tour in the Cevennes which he has described under the title 
<i>Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes</i>, with Modestine, 
sometimes doubting which was the donkey, but on that tour a chill
caught either developed a germ of lung disease already present, 
or produced it; and the results unfortunately remained.</p>
<p>He never practised at the Bar, though he tells facetiously of 
his one brief.&nbsp; He had chosen his own vocation, which was 
literature, and the years which followed were, despite the 
delicacy which showed itself, very busy years.&nbsp; He produced 
volume on volume.&nbsp; He had written many stories which had 
never seen the light, but, as he says, passed through the ordeal 
of the fire by more or less circuitous ways.</p>
<p>By this time some trouble and cause for anxiety had arisen 
about the lungs, and trials of various places had been 
made.&nbsp; <i>Ordered South</i> suggests the Mediterranean, 
sunny Italy, the Riviera.&nbsp; Then a sea-trip to America was 
recommended and undertaken.&nbsp; Unfortunately, he got worse 
there, his original cause of trouble was complicated with others,
and the medical treatment given was stupid, and exaggerated some 
of the symptoms instead of removing them, All along&mdash;up, at 
all events, to the time of his settlement in 
Samoa&mdash;Stevenson was more or less of an invalid.</p>
<p>Indeed, were I ever to write an essay on the art of wisely 
&ldquo;laying-to,&rdquo; as the sailors say, I would point it by 
a reference to R. L. Stevenson.&nbsp; For there is a wise way of 
&ldquo;laying-to&rdquo; that does not imply inaction, but 
discreet, well-directed effort, against contrary winds and rough 
seas, that is, amid obstacles and drawbacks, and even ill-health,
where passive and active may balance and give effect to each 
other.&nbsp; Stevenson was by native instinct and temperament a 
rover&mdash;a lover of adventure, of strange by-ways, errant 
tracts (as seen in his <i>Inland Voyage</i> and <i>Travels with a
Donkey through the Cevennes</i>&mdash;seen yet more, perhaps, in 
a certain account of a voyage to America as a steerage 
passenger), lofty mountain-tops, with stronger air, and strange 
and novel surroundings.&nbsp; He would fain, like Ulysses, be at 
home in foreign lands, making acquaintance with outlying races, 
with</p>

<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Cities
of men,<br />
And manners, climates, councils, governments:<br />
Myself not least, but honoured of them all,<br />
Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If he could not move about as he would, he would invent, make 
fancy serve him instead of experience.&nbsp; We thus owe 
something to the staying and restraining forces in him, and a 
wise &ldquo;laying-to&rdquo;&mdash;for his works, which are, in 
large part, finely-healthy, objective, and in almost everything 
unlike the work of an invalid, yet, in some degree, were but the 
devices to beguile the burdens of an invalid&rsquo;s days.&nbsp; 
Instead of remaining in our climate, it might be, to lie listless
and helpless half the day, with no companion but his own thoughts
and fancies (not always so pleasant either, if, like 
Frankenstein&rsquo;s monster, or, better still like the imp in 
the bottle in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, you cannot, once for all
liberate them, and set them adrift on their own charges to visit 
other people), he made a home in the sweeter air and more steady 
climate of the South Pacific, where, under the Southern Cross, he
could safely and beneficially be as active as he would be 
involuntarily idle at home, or work only under pressure of 
hampering conditions.&nbsp; That was surely an illustration of 
the true &ldquo;laying-to&rdquo; with an unaffectedly brave, 
bright resolution in it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI&mdash;SOME EARLIER LETTERS</h2>
<p>Carlyle was wont to say that, next to a faithful portrait, 
familiar letters were the best medium to reveal a man.&nbsp; The 
letters must have been written with no idea of being used for 
this end, however&mdash;free, artless, the unstudied 
self-revealings of mind and heart.&nbsp; Now, these letters of R.
L. Stevenson, written to his friends in England, have a vast 
value in this way&mdash;they reveal the man&mdash;reveal him in 
his strength and his weakness&mdash;his ready gift in pleasing 
and adapting himself to those with whom he corresponded, and his 
great power at once of adapting himself to his circumstances and 
of humorously rising superior to them.&nbsp; When he was ill and 
almost penniless in San Francisco, he could give Mr Colvin this 
account of his daily routine:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Any time between eight and half-past nine 
in the morning a slender gentleman in an ulster, with a volume 
buttoned into the breast of it, maybe observed leaving No. 608 
Bush and descending Powell with an active step.&nbsp; The 
gentleman is R. L. Stevenson; the volume relates to Benjamin 
Franklin, on whom he meditates one of his charming essays.&nbsp; 
He descends Powell, crosses Market, and descends in Sixth on a 
branch of the original Pine Street Coffee-House, no less. . . . 
He seats himself at a table covered with waxcloth, and a pampered
menial of High-Dutch extraction, and, indeed, as yet only 
partially extracted, lays before him a cup of coffee, a roll, and
a pat of butter, all, to quote the deity, very good.&nbsp; A 
while ago, and R. L. Stevenson used to find the supply of butter 
insufficient; but he has now learned the art to exactitude, and 
butter and roll expire at the same moment.&nbsp; For this 
rejection he pays ten cents, or fivepence sterling (&pound;0 0s. 
5d.).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Half an hour later, the inhabitants of Bush Street 
observed the same slender gentleman armed, like George 
Washington, with his little hatchet, splitting kindling, and 
breaking coal for his fire.&nbsp; He does this quasi-publicly 
upon the window-sill; but this is not to be attributed to any 
love of notoriety, though he is indeed vain of his prowess with 
the hatchet (which he persists in calling an axe), and daily 
surprised at the perpetuation of his fingers.&nbsp; The reason is
this: That the sill is a strong supporting beam, and that blows 
of the same emphasis in other parts of his room might knock the 
entire shanty into hell.&nbsp; Thenceforth, for from three hours,
he is engaged darkly with an ink-bottle.&nbsp; Yet he is not 
blacking his boots, for the only pair that he possesses are 
innocent of lustre, and wear the natural hue of the material 
turned up with caked and venerable slush.&nbsp; The youngest 
child of his landlady remarks several times a day, as this 
strange occupant enters or quits the house, &lsquo;Dere&rsquo;s 
de author.&rsquo;&nbsp; Can it be that this bright-haired 
innocent has found the true clue to the mystery?&nbsp; The being 
in question is, at least, poor enough to belong to that 
honourable craft.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here are a few letters belonging to the winter of 1887-88, 
nearly all written from Saranac Lake, in the Adirondacks, 
celebrated by Emerson, and now a most popular holiday resort in 
the United States, and were originally published in 
<i>Scribner&rsquo;s Magazine</i>. . . &ldquo;It should be said 
that, after his long spell of weakness at Bournemouth, Stevenson 
had gone West in search of health among the bleak hill 
summits&mdash;&lsquo;on the Canadian border of New York State, 
very unsettled and primitive and cold.&rsquo;&nbsp; He had made 
the voyage in an ocean tramp, the <i>Ludgate Hill</i>, the sort 
of craft which any person not a born child of the sea would shun 
in horror.&nbsp; Stevenson, however, had &lsquo;the finest time 
conceivable on board the &ldquo;strange floating 
menagerie.&rdquo;&rsquo;&rdquo;&nbsp; Thus he describes it in a 
letter to Mr Henry James:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Stallions and monkeys and matches made our 
cargo; and the vast continent of these incongruities rolled the 
while like a haystack; and the stallions stood hypnotised by the 
motion, looking through the port at our dinner-table, and winked 
when the crockery was broken; and the little monkeys stared at 
each other in their cages, and were thrown overboard like little 
bluish babies; and the big monkey, Jacko, scoured about the ship 
and rested willingly in my arms, to the ruin of my clothing; and 
the man of the stallions made a bower of the black tarpaulin, and
sat therein at the feet of a raddled divinity, like a picture on 
a box of chocolates; and the other passengers, when they were not
sick, looked on and laughed.&nbsp; Take all this picture, and 
make it roll till the bell shall sound unexpected notes and the 
fittings shall break loose in our stateroom, and you have the 
voyage of the <i>Ludgate Hill</i>.&nbsp; She arrived in the port 
of New York without beer, porter, soda-water, cura&ccedil;oa, 
fresh meat, or fresh water; and yet we lived, and we regret 
her.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He discovered this that there is no joy in the Universe 
comparable to life on a villainous ocean tramp, rolling through a
horrible sea in company with a cargo of cattle.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have got one good thing of my sea voyage;
it is proved the sea agrees heartily with me, and my mother likes
it; so if I get any better, or no worse, my mother will likely 
hire a yacht for a month or so in the summer.&nbsp; Good Lord! 
what fun!&nbsp; Wealth is only useful for two things: a yacht and
a string quartette.&nbsp; For these two I will sell my 
soul.&nbsp; Except for these I hold that &pound;700 a year is as 
much as anybody can possibly want; and I have had more, so I 
know, for the extra coins were of no use, excepting for illness, 
which damns everything.&nbsp; I was so happy on board that ship, 
I could not have believed it possible; we had the beastliest 
weather, and many discomforts; but the mere fact of its being a 
tramp ship gave us many comforts.&nbsp; We could cut about with 
the men and officers, stay in the wheel-house, discuss all manner
of things, and really be a little at sea.&nbsp; And truly there 
is nothing else.&nbsp; I had literally forgotten what happiness 
was, and the full mind&mdash;full of external and physical 
things, not full of cares and labours, and rot about a 
fellow&rsquo;s behaviour.&nbsp; My heart literally sang; I truly 
care for nothing so much as for that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To go ashore for your letters and hang about the pier 
among the holiday yachtsmen&mdash;that&rsquo;s fame, that&rsquo;s
glory&mdash;and nobody can take it away.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At Saranac Lake the Stevensons lived in a 
&ldquo;wind-beleaguered hill-top hat-box of a house,&rdquo; which
suited the invalid, but, on the other hand, invalided his 
wife.&nbsp; Soon after getting there he plunged into <i>The 
Master of Ballantrae</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;No thought have I now apart from it, and I 
have got along up to page ninety-two of the draught with great 
interest.&nbsp; It is to me a most seizing tale: there are some 
fantastic elements, the most is a dead genuine human 
problem&mdash;human tragedy, I should say rather.&nbsp; It will 
be about as long, I imagine, as <i>Kidnapped</i>. . . . I have 
done most of the big work, the quarrel, duel between the 
brothers, and the announcement of the death to Clementina and my 
Lord&mdash;Clementina, Henry, and Mackellar (nicknamed 
Squaretoes) are really very fine fellows; the Master is all I 
know of the devil; I have known hints of him, in the world, but 
always cowards: he is as bold as a lion, but with the same 
deadly, causeless duplicity I have watched with so much surprise 
in my two cowards.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis true, I saw a hint of the 
same nature in another man who was not a coward; but he had other
things to attend to; the Master has nothing else but his 
devilry.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His wife grows seriously ill, and Stevenson has to turn to 
household work.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Lloyd and I get breakfast; I have now, 
10.15, just got the dishes washed and the kitchen all clean, and 
sit down to give you as much news as I have spirit for, after 
such an engagement.&nbsp; Glass is a thing that really breaks my 
spirit; and I do not like to fail, and with glass I cannot reach 
the work of my high calling&mdash;the artist&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the midst of such domestic tasks and entanglements he 
writes <i>The Master</i>, and very characteristically gets 
dissatisfied with the last parts, &ldquo;which shame, perhaps 
degrade, the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of Mr Kipling this is his judgment&mdash;in the year 1890:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Kipling is by far the most promising young 
man who has appeared since&mdash;ahem&mdash;I appeared.&nbsp; He 
amazes me by his precocity and various endowments.&nbsp; But he 
alarms me by his copiousness and haste.&nbsp; He should shield 
his fire with both hands, &lsquo;and draw up all his strength and
sweetness in one ball.&rsquo;&nbsp; (&lsquo;Draw all his strength
and all his sweetness up into one ball&rsquo;?&nbsp; I cannot 
remember Marvell&rsquo;s words.)&nbsp; So the critics have been 
saying to me; but I was never capable of&mdash;and surely never 
guilty of&mdash;such a debauch of production.&nbsp; At this rate 
his works will soon fill the habitable globe, and surely he was 
armed for better conflicts than these succinct sketches and 
flying leaves of verse?&nbsp; I look on, I admire, I rejoice for 
myself; but in a kind of ambition we all have for our tongue and 
literature I am wounded.&nbsp; If I had this man&rsquo;s 
fertility and courage, it seems to me I could heave a 
pyramid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we begin to be the old fogies now, and it was 
high time <i>something</i> rose to take our places.&nbsp; 
Certainly Kipling has the gifts; the fairy godmothers were all 
tipsy at his christening.&nbsp; What will he do with 
them?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of the rest of Stevenson&rsquo;s career we cannot speak at 
length, nor is it needful.&nbsp; How in steady succession came 
his triumphs: came, too, his trials from ill-health&mdash;how he 
spent winters at Davos Platz, Bournemouth, and tried other places
in America; and how, at last, good fortune led him to the South 
Pacific.&nbsp; After many voyagings and wanderings among the 
islands, he settled near Apia, in Samoa, early in 1890, cleared 
some four hundred acres, and built a house; where, while he wrote
what delighted the English-speaking race, he took on himself the 
defence of the natives against foreign interlopers, writing under
the title <i>A Footnote to History</i>, the most powerful 
<i>expos&eacute;</i> of the mischief they had done and were doing
there.&nbsp; He was the beloved of the natives, as he made 
himself the friend of all with whom he came in contact.&nbsp; 
There, as at home, he worked&mdash;worked with the same 
determination and in the enjoyment of better health.&nbsp; The 
obtaining idea with him, up to the end, as it had been from early
life, was a brave, resolute, cheerful endeavour to make the best 
of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I chose Samoa instead of Honolulu,&rdquo; he told Mr W.
H. Trigg, who reports the talk in <i>Cassells&rsquo; 
Magazine</i>, &ldquo;for the simple and eminently satisfactory 
reason that it is less civilised.&nbsp; Can you not conceive that
it is awful fun?&rdquo;&nbsp; His house was called 
&ldquo;Vailima,&rdquo; which means Five Waters in the Samoan, and
indicates the number of streams that flow by the spot.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER VII&mdash;THE VAILIMA LETTERS</h2>
<p>The Vailima Letters, written to Mr Sidney Colvin and other 
friends, are in their way delightful if not inimitable: and this,
in spite of the idea having occurred to him, that some use might 
hereafter be made of these letters for publication 
purposes.&nbsp; There is, indeed, as little trace of any change 
in the style through this as well could be&mdash;the utterly 
familiar, easy, almost child-like flow remains, unmarred by 
self-consciousness or tendency &ldquo;to put it on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In June, 1892, Stevenson says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It came over me the other day suddenly that
this diary of mine to you would make good pickings after I am 
dead, and a man could make some kind of a book out of it, without
much trouble.&nbsp; So for God&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t lose 
them, and they will prove a piece of provision for &lsquo;my 
floor old family,&rsquo; as Simel&eacute; calls it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But their great charm remains: they are as free and gracious 
and serious and playful and informal as before.&nbsp; 
Stevenson&rsquo;s traits of character are all here: his largeness
of heart, his delicacy, his sympathy, his fun, his pathos, his 
boylike frolicsomeness, his fine courage, his love of the sea 
(for he was by nature a sailor), his passion for action and 
adventure despite his ill-health, his great patience with others 
and fine adaptability to their temper (he says that he never gets
out of temper with those he has to do with), his unbounded, 
big-hearted hopefulness, and fine perseverance in face of 
difficulties.&nbsp; What could be better than the way in which he
tells that in January, 1892, when he had a bout of influenza and 
was dictating <i>St Ives</i> to his stepdaughter, Mrs Strong, he 
was &ldquo;reduced to dictating to her in the deaf-and-dumb 
alphabet&rdquo;?&mdash;and goes on:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The amanuensis has her head quite turned, 
and believes herself to be the author of this novel [<i>and is to
some extent</i>.&mdash;A.M.] and as the creature (!) has not been
wholly useless in the matter [<i>I told you so</i>!&mdash;A.M.] I
propose to foster her vanity by a little commemoration gift! . . 
. I shall tell you on some other occasion, and when the A.M. is 
out of hearing, how <i>very</i> much I propose to invest in this 
testimonial; but I may as well inform you at once that I intend 
it to be cheap, sir&mdash;damned cheap!&nbsp; My idea of running 
amanuenses is by praise, not pudding, flattery, and not 
coins.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Truly, a rare and rich nature which could thus draw sunshine 
out of its trials!&mdash;which, by aid of the true 
philosopher&rsquo;s stone of cheerfulness and courage, could 
transmute the heavy dust and clay to gold.</p>
<p>His interests are so wide that he is sometimes pulled in 
different and conflicting directions, as in the contest between 
his desire to aid Mataafa and the other chiefs, and his literary 
work&mdash;between letters to the <i>Times</i> about Samoan 
politics, and, say, <i>David Balfour</i>.&nbsp; Here is a 
characteristic bit in that strain:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I have a good dose of the devil in my 
pipestem atomy; I have had my little holiday outing in my kick at
<i>The Young Chevalier</i>, and I guess I can settle to <i>David 
Balfour</i>, to-morrow or Friday like a little man.&nbsp; I 
wonder if any one had ever more energy upon so little 
strength?&nbsp; I know there is a frost; . . . but I mean to 
break that frost inside two years, and pull off a big success, 
and Vanity whispers in my ear that I have the strength.&nbsp; If 
I haven&rsquo;t, whistle owre the lave o&rsquo;t!&nbsp; I can do 
without glory, and perhaps the time is not far off when I can do 
without corn.&nbsp; It is a time coming soon enough, anyway; and 
I have endured some two and forty years without public shame, and
had a good time as I did it.&nbsp; If only I could secure a 
violent death, what a fine success!&nbsp; I wish to die in my 
boots; no more Land of Counterpane for me.&nbsp; To be drowned, 
to be shot, to be thrown from a horse&mdash;ay, to be hanged, 
rather than pass again through that slow dissolution.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He would not consent to act the invalid unless the spring ran 
down altogether; was keen for exercise and for mixing among 
men&mdash;his native servants if no others were near by.&nbsp; 
Here is a bit of confession and casuistry quite <i>&agrave; 
la</i> Stevenson:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To come down covered with mud and drenched 
with sweat and rain after some hours in the bush, change, rub 
down, and take a chair in the verandah, is to taste a quiet 
conscience.&nbsp; And the strange thing that I mark is this: If I
go out and make sixpence, bossing my labourers and plying the 
cutlass or the spade, idiot conscience applauds me; if I sit in 
the house and make twenty pounds, idiot conscience wails over my 
neglect and the day wasted.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His relish for companionship is indeed strong.&nbsp; At one 
place he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God knows I don&rsquo;t care who I chum 
with perhaps I like sailors best, but to go round and sue and 
sneak to keep a crowd together&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Stevenson&rsquo;s natural bent was to be an explorer, a 
mountain-climber, or a sailor&mdash;to sail wide seas, or to 
range on mountain-tops to gain free and extensive views&mdash;yet
he inclines well to farmer work, and indeed, has to confess it 
has a rare attraction for him.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I went crazy over outdoor work,&rdquo; he 
says at one place, &ldquo;and had at last to confine myself to 
the house, or literature must have gone by the board.&nbsp; 
<i>Nothing</i> is so interesting as weeding, clearing, and 
path-making: the oversight of labourers becomes a disease.&nbsp; 
It is quite an effort not to drop into the farmer; and it does 
make you feel so well.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The odd ways of these Samoans, their pride of position, their 
vices, their virtues, their vanities, their small thefts, their 
tricks, their delightful <i>insouciance</i> sometimes, all amused
him.&nbsp; He found in them a fine field of study and 
observation&mdash;a source of fun and fund of humanity&mdash;as 
this bit about the theft of some piglings will sufficiently 
prove:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Last night three piglings were stolen from 
one of our pig-pens.&nbsp; The great Lafaele appeared to my wife 
uneasy, so she engaged him in conversation on the subject, and 
played upon him the following engaging trick: You advance your 
two forefingers towards the sitter&rsquo;s eyes; he closes them, 
whereupon you substitute (on his eyelids) the fore and middle 
fingers of the left hand, and with your right (which he supposes 
engaged) you tap him on the head and back.&nbsp; When you let him
open his eyes, he sees you withdrawing the two forefingers.&nbsp;
&lsquo;What that?&rsquo; asked Lafaele.&nbsp; &lsquo;My 
devil,&rsquo; says Fanny.&nbsp; &lsquo;I wake um, my devil.&nbsp;
All right now.&nbsp; He go catch the man that catch my 
pig.&rsquo;&nbsp; About an hour afterwards Lafaele came for 
further particulars.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh, all right,&rsquo; my wife 
says.&nbsp; &lsquo;By-and-by that man be sleep, devil go sleep 
same place.&nbsp; By-and-by that man plenty sick.&nbsp; I no 
care.&nbsp; What for he take my pig?&rsquo;&nbsp; Lafaele cares 
plenty; I don&rsquo;t think he is the man, though he may be; but 
he knows him, and most likely will eat some of that pig 
to-night.&nbsp; He will not eat with relish.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yet in spite of this R. L. Stevenson declares that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;They are a perfectly honest people: nothing
of value has ever been taken from our house, where doors and 
windows are always wide open; and upon one occasion when white 
ants attacked the silver chest, the whole of my family treasure 
lay spread upon the floor of the hall for two days 
unguarded.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is a bit on a work of peace, a reflection on a 
day&rsquo;s weeding at Vailima&mdash;in its way almost as 
touching as any:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I wonder if any one had ever the same 
attitude to Nature as I hold, and have held for so long?&nbsp; 
This business fascinates me like a tune or a passion; yet all the
while I thrill with a strong distaste.&nbsp; The horror of the 
thing, objective and subjective, is always present to my mind; 
the horror of creeping things, a superstitious horror of the void
and the powers about me, the horror of my own devastation and 
continual murders.&nbsp; The life of the plants comes through my 
finger-tips, their struggles go to my heart like 
supplications.&nbsp; I feel myself blood-boltered; then I look 
back on my cleared grass, and count myself an ally in a fair 
quarrel, and make stout my heart.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, again, is the way in which he celebrates an act of 
friendly kindness on the part of Mr Gosse:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear 
Gosse</span>,&mdash;Your letter was to me such a bright spot that
I answer it right away to the prejudice of other correspondents 
or&mdash;dants (don&rsquo;t know how to spell it) who have prior 
claims. . . . It is the history of our kindnesses that alone 
makes this world tolerable.&nbsp; If it were not for that, for 
the effect of kind words, kind looks, kind letters, multiplying, 
spreading, making one happy through another and bringing forth 
benefits, some thirty, some fifty, some a thousandfold, I should 
be tempted to think our life a practical jest in the worst 
possible spirit.&nbsp; So your four pages have confirmed my 
philosophy as well as consoled my heart in these ill 
hours.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII&mdash;WORK OF LATER YEARS</h2>
<p>Mr Hammerton, in his <i>Stevensoniana</i> (pp. 323-4), has 
given the humorous inscriptions on the volumes of his works which
Stevenson presented to Dr Trudeau, who attended him when he was 
in Saranac in 1887-88&mdash;very characteristic in every way, and
showing fully Stevenson&rsquo;s fine appreciation of any 
attention or service.&nbsp; On the <i>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i> 
volume he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Trudeau was all the winter at my side:<br 
/>
I never saw the nose of Mr Hyde.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And on <i>Kidnapped</i> is this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here is the one sound page of all my 
writing,<br />
The one I&rsquo;m proud of and that I delight in.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stevenson was exquisite in this class of efforts, and were 
they all collected they would form indeed, a fine supplement and 
illustration of the leading lesson of his essays&mdash;the true 
art of pleasing others, and of truly pleasing one&rsquo;s self at
the same time.&nbsp; To my thinking the finest of all in this 
line is the legal (?) deed by which he conveyed his birthday to 
little Miss Annie Ide, the daughter of Mr H. C. Ide, a well-known
American, who was for several years a resident of Upolo, in 
Samoa, first as Land Commissioner, and later as Chief Justice 
under the joint appointment of England, Germany, and the United 
States.&nbsp; While living at Apia, Mr Ide and his family were 
very intimate with the family of R. L. Stevenson.&nbsp; Little 
Annie was a special pet and prot&eacute;g&eacute; of Stevenson 
and his wife.&nbsp; After the return of the Ides to their 
American home, Stevenson &ldquo;deeded&rdquo; to Annie his 
birthday in the following unique document:</p>
<blockquote><p>I, <span class="smcap">Robert Louis 
Stevenson</span>, advocate of the Scots Bar, author of <i>The 
Master of Ballantrae</i> and <i>Moral Emblems</i>, civil 
engineer, sole owner and patentee of the palace and plantation 
known as Vailima, in the island of Upolo, Samoa, a British 
subject, being in sound mind, and pretty well, I thank you, in 
mind and body;</p>
<p>In consideration that Miss Annie H. Ide, daughter of H. C. 
Ide, in the town of Saint Johnsbury, in the County of Caledonia, 
in the State of Vermont, United States of America, was born, out 
of all reason, upon Christmas Day, and is, therefore, out of all 
justice, denied the consolation and profit of a proper 
birthday;</p>
<p>And considering that I, the said Robert Louis Stevenson, have 
attained the age when we never mention it, and that I have now no
further use for a birthday of any description;</p>
<p>And in consideration that I have met H. C. Ide, the father of 
the said Annie H. Ide, and found him as white a land commissioner
as I require, I have transferred, and do hereby transfer, to the 
said Annie H. Ide, all and whole of my rights and privileges in 
the 13th day of November, formerly my birthday, now, hereby and 
henceforth, the birthday of the said Annie H. Ide, to have, hold,
exercise, and enjoy the same in the customary manner, by the 
sporting of fine raiment, eating of rich meats, and receipt of 
gifts, compliments, and copies of verse, according to the manner 
of our ancestors;</p>
<p>And I direct the said Annie H. Ide to add to the said name of 
Annie H. Ide the name of Louisa&mdash;at least in 
private&mdash;and I charge her to use my said birthday with 
moderation and humanity, <i>et tamquam bona filia familias</i>, 
the said birthday not being so young as it once was and having 
carried me in a very satisfactory manner since I can 
remember;</p>
<p>And in case the said Annie H. Ide shall neglect or contravene 
either of the above conditions, I hereby revoke the donation and 
transfer my rights in the said birthday to the President of the 
United States of America for the time being.</p>
<p>In witness whereof I have hereto set my hand and seal this 
19th day of June, in the year of grace eighteen hundred and 
ninety-one.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>He died in Samoa in December 1894&mdash;not from phthisis or 
anything directly connected with it, but from the bursting of a 
blood-vessel and suffusion of blood on the brain.&nbsp; He had up
to the moment almost of his sudden and unexpected death been busy
on <i>Weir of Hermiston</i> and <i>St Ives</i>, which he left 
unfinished&mdash;the latter having been brought to a conclusion 
by Mr Quiller-Couch.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX&mdash;SOME CHARACTERISTICS</h2>
<p>In Stevenson we lost one of the most powerful writers of our 
day, as well as the most varied in theme and style.&nbsp; When I 
use the word &ldquo;powerful,&rdquo; I do not mean merely the 
producing of the most striking or sensational results, nor the 
facility of weaving a fascinating or blood-curdling plot; I mean 
the writer who seemed always to have most in reserve&mdash;a 
secret fund of power and fascination which always pointed beyond 
the printed page, and set before the attentive and careful reader
a strange but fascinating <i>personality</i>.&nbsp; Other authors
have done that in measure.&nbsp; There was Hawthorne, behind 
whose writings there is always the wistful, cold, far-withdrawn 
spectator of human nature&mdash;eerie, inquisitive, and, I had 
almost said, inquisitorial&mdash;a little bloodless, eerie, 
weird, and cobwebby.&nbsp; There was Dr Wendell Holmes, with his 
problems of heredity, of race-mixture and weird inoculation, as 
in <i>Elsie Venner</i> and <i>The Guardian Angel</i>, and there 
were Poe and Charles Whitehead.&nbsp; Stevenson, in a few of his 
writings&mdash;in one of the <i>Merry Men</i> chapters and in 
<i>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i>, and, to some extent, in <i>The 
Master of Ballantrae</i>&mdash;showed that he could enter on the 
obscure and, in a sense, weird and metaphysical elements in human
life; though always there was, too, a touch at least of gloomy 
suggestion, from which, as it seemed, he could not there wholly 
escape.&nbsp; But always, too, there was a touch that suggests 
the universal.</p>
<p>Even in the stories that would be classed as those of incident
and adventure merely, <i>Treasure Island</i>, <i>Kidnapped</i>, 
and the rest, there is a sense as of some unaffected but fine 
symbolism that somehow touches something of possibility in 
yourself as you read.&nbsp; The simplest narrative from his hand 
proclaimed itself a deep study in human nature&mdash;its motives 
tendencies, and possibilities.&nbsp; In these stories there is 
promise at once of the most realistic imagination, the most 
fantastic romance, keen insights into some sides of human nature,
and weird fancies, as well as the most delicate and dainty 
pictures of character.&nbsp; And this is precisely what we 
have&mdash;always with a vein of the finest autobiography&mdash;a
kind of select and indirect self-revelation&mdash;often with a 
touch of quaintness, a subdued humour, and sweet-blooded vagary, 
if we may be allowed the word, which make you feel towards the 
writer as towards a friend.&nbsp; He was too much an artist to 
overdo this, and his strength lies there, that generally he 
suggests and turns away at the right point, with a smile, as you 
ask for <i>more</i>.&nbsp; Look how he sets, half slyly, these 
words into the mouth of David Balfour on his first meeting with 
Catriona in one of the steep wynds or closes off the High Street 
of Edinburgh:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There is no greater wonder than the way the
face of a young woman fits in a man&rsquo;s mind, and stays 
there, and he never could tell you why: it just seems it was the 
thing he wanted.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Take this alongside of his remark made to his mother while 
still a youth&mdash;&ldquo;that he did not care to understand the
strain on a bridge&rdquo; (when he tried to study engineering); 
what he wanted was something with human nature in it.&nbsp; His 
style, in his essays, etc., where he writes in his own person, is
most polished, full of phrases finely drawn; when he speaks 
through others, as in <i>Kidnapped</i> and <i>David Balfour</i>, 
it is still fine and effective, and generally it is fairly true 
to the character, with cunning glimpses, nevertheless, of his own
temper and feeling too.&nbsp; He makes us feel his confidants and
friends, as has been said.&nbsp; One could almost construct a 
biography from his essays and his novels&mdash;the one would give
us the facts of his life suffused with fancy and ideal colour, 
humour and fine observation not wanting; the other would give us 
the history of his mental and moral being and development, and of
the traits and determinations which he drew from along a 
lengthened line of progenitors.&nbsp; How characteristic it is of
him&mdash;a man who for so many years suffered as an 
invalid&mdash;that he should lay it down that the two great 
virtues, including all others, were cheerfulness and delight in 
labour.</p>
<p>One writer has very well said on this feature in 
Stevenson:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Other authors have struggled bravely 
against physical weakness, but their work has not usually been of
a creative order, dependent for its success on high animal 
spirits.&nbsp; They have written histories, essays, contemplative
or didactic poems, works which may more or less be regarded as 
&lsquo;dull narcotics numbing pain.&rsquo;&nbsp; But who, in so 
fragile a frame as Robert Louis Stevenson&rsquo;s, has retained 
such indomitable elasticity, such fertility of invention, such 
unflagging energy, not merely to collect and arrange, but to 
project and body forth?&nbsp; Has any true &lsquo;maker&rsquo; 
been such an incessant sufferer?&nbsp; From his childhood, as he 
himself said apropos of the <i>Child&rsquo;s Garden</i>, he could
&lsquo;speak with less authority of gardens than of that other 
&ldquo;land of counterpane.&rdquo;&rsquo;&nbsp; There were, 
indeed, a few years of adolescence during which his health was 
tolerable, but they were years of apprenticeship to life and art 
(&lsquo;pioching,&rsquo; as he called it), not of serious 
production.&nbsp; Though he was a precocious child, his genius 
ripened slowly, and it was just reaching maturity when the 
&lsquo;wolverine,&rsquo; as he called his disease, fixed its 
fangs in his flesh.&nbsp; From that time forward not only did he 
live with death at his elbow in an almost literal sense (he used 
to carry his left arm in a sling lest a too sudden movement 
should bring on a h&aelig;morrhage), but he had ever-recurring 
intervals of weeks and months during which he was totally unfit 
for work; while even at the best of times he had to husband his 
strength most jealously.&nbsp; Add to all this that he was a slow
and laborious writer, who would take more pains with a phrase 
than Scott with a chapter&mdash;then look at the stately shelf of
his works, brimful of impulse, initiative, and the joy of life, 
and say whether it be an exaggeration to call his tenacity and 
fortitude unique!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Samoa, with its fine climate, prolonged his life&mdash;we had 
fain hoped that in that air he found so favourable he might have 
lived for many years, to add to the precious stock of innocent 
delight he has given to the world&mdash;to do yet more and 
greater.&nbsp; It was not to be.&nbsp; They buried him, with full
native honours as to a chief, on the top of Vaea mountain, 1300 
feet high&mdash;a road for the coffin to pass being cut through 
the woods on the slopes of the hill.&nbsp; There he has a 
resting-place not all unfit&mdash;for he sought the pure and 
clearer air on the heights from whence there are widest 
prospects; yet not in the spot he would have chosen&mdash;for his
heart was at home, and not very long before his death he sang, 
surely with pathetic reference now:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Spring shall come, come again, calling up 
the moorfowl,<br />
Spring shall bring the sun and rain, bring the bees and 
flowers,<br />
Red shall the heather bloom over hill and valley,<br />
Soft flow the stream thro&rsquo; the even-flowing hours;<br />
Fair the day shine, as it shone upon my childhood&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fair shine the day on the house with open door;<br 
/>
Birds come and cry there, and twitter in the chimney&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But I go for ever and come again no more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER X&mdash;A SAMOAN MEMORIAL OF R. L. STEVENSON</h2>
<p>A few weeks after his death, the mail from Samoa, brought to 
Stevenson&rsquo;s friends, myself among the number, a precious, 
if pathetic, memorial of the master.&nbsp; It is in the form of 
&ldquo;A Letter to Mr Stevenson&rsquo;s Friends,&rdquo; by his 
stepson, Mr Lloyd Osbourne, and bears the motto from Walt 
Whitman, &ldquo;I have been waiting for you these many 
years.&nbsp; Give me your hand and welcome.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr 
Osbourne gives a full account of the last hours.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He wrote hard all that morning of the last 
day; his half-finished book, <i>Hermiston</i>, he judged the best
he had ever written, and the sense of successful effort made him 
buoyant and happy as nothing else could.&nbsp; In the afternoon 
the mail fell to be answered&mdash;not business correspondence, 
for this was left till later&mdash;but replies to the long, 
kindly letters of distant friends received but two days since, 
and still bright in memory.&nbsp; At sunset he came downstairs; 
rallied his wife about the forebodings she could not shake off; 
talked of a lecturing tour to America that he was eager to make, 
&lsquo;as he was now so well&rsquo;; and played a game of cards 
with her to drive away her melancholy.&nbsp; He said he was 
hungry; begged her assistance to help him make a salad for the 
evening meal; and, to enhance the little feast he brought up a 
bottle of old Burgundy from the cellar.&nbsp; He was helping his 
wife on the verandah, and gaily talking, when suddenly he put 
both hands to his head and cried out, &lsquo;What&rsquo;s 
that?&rsquo;&nbsp; Then he asked quickly, &lsquo;Do I look 
strange?&rsquo;&nbsp; Even as he did so he fell on his knees 
beside her.&nbsp; He was helped into the great hall, between his 
wife and his body-servant, Sosimo, losing consciousness instantly
as he lay back in the armchair that had once been his 
grandfather&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Little time was lost in bringing the 
doctors&mdash;Anderson of the man-of-war, and his friend, Dr 
Funk.&nbsp; They looked at him and shook their heads; they 
laboured strenuously, and left nothing undone.&nbsp; But he had 
passed the bounds of human skill.&nbsp; He had grown so well and 
strong, that his wasted lungs were unable to bear the stress of 
returning health.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then &rsquo;tis told how the Rev. Mr Clarke came and prayed by
him; and how, soon after, the chiefs were summoned, and came, 
bringing their fine mats, which, laid on the body, almost hid the
Union jack in which it had been wrapped.&nbsp; One of the old 
Mataafa chiefs, who had been in prison, and who had been one of 
those who worked on the making of the &ldquo;Road of the Loving 
Heart&rdquo; (the road of gratitude which the chiefs had made up 
to Mr Stevenson&rsquo;s house as a mark of their appreciation of 
his efforts on their behalf), came and crouched beside the body 
and said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I am only a poor Samoan, and 
ignorant.&nbsp; Others are rich, and can give Tusitala <a 
name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6" 
class="citation">[6]</a> the parting presents of rich, fine mats;
I am poor, and can give nothing this last day he receives his 
friends.&nbsp; Yet I am not afraid to come and look the last time
in my friend&rsquo;s face, never to see him more till we meet 
with God.&nbsp; Behold!&nbsp; Tusitala is dead; Mataafa is also 
dead.&nbsp; These two great friends have been taken by God.&nbsp;
When Mataafa was taken, who was our support but Tusitala?&nbsp; 
We were in prison, and he cared for us.&nbsp; We were sick, and 
he made us well.&nbsp; We were hungry, and he fed us.&nbsp; The 
day was no longer than his kindness.&nbsp; You are great people, 
and full of love.&nbsp; Yet who among you is so great as 
Tusitala?&nbsp; What is your love to his love?&nbsp; Our clan was
Mataafa&rsquo;s clan, for whom I speak this day; therein was 
Tusitala also.&nbsp; We mourn them both.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A select company of Samoans would not be deterred, and watched
by the body all night, chanting songs, with bits of Catholic 
prayers; and in the morning the work began of clearing a path 
through the wood on the hill to the spot on the crown where Mr 
Stevenson had expressed a wish to be buried.&nbsp; The following 
prayer, which Mr Stevenson had written and read aloud to his 
family only the night before, was read by Mr Clarke in the 
service:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We beseech thee, Lord, to behold us with 
favour, folk of many families and nations, gathered together in 
the peace of this roof; weak men and women, subsisting under the 
covert of Thy patience.&nbsp; Be patient still; suffer us yet a 
while longer&mdash;with our broken purposes of good, with our 
idle endeavours against evil&mdash;suffer us a while longer to 
endure, and (if it may be) help us to do better.&nbsp; Bless to 
us our extraordinary mercies; if the day come when these must be 
taken, have us play the man under affliction.&nbsp; Be with our 
friends; be with ourselves.&nbsp; Go with each of us to rest: if 
any awake, temper to them the dark hours of watching; and when 
the day returns to us, our Sun and Comforter, call us up with 
morning faces and with morning hearts&mdash;eager to 
labour&mdash;eager to be happy, if happiness shall be our 
portion; and if the day be marked for sorrow, strong to endure 
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thank Thee and praise Thee, and in the words of Him 
to whom this day is sacred, close our oblations.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Bazzet M. Haggard, H.B.M., Land-Commissioner, tells, by way
of reminiscence, the story of &ldquo;The Road of Good 
Heart,&rdquo; how it came to be built, and of the great feast Mr 
Stevenson gave at the close of the work, at which, in the course 
of his speech, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You are all aware in some degree of what 
has happened.&nbsp; You know those chiefs to have been prisoners;
you perhaps know that during the term of their confinement I had 
it in my power to do them certain favours.&nbsp; One thing some 
of you cannot know, that they were immediately repaid by 
answering attentions.&nbsp; They were liberated by the new 
Administration. . . .&nbsp; As soon as they were free 
men&mdash;owing no man anything&mdash;instead of going home to 
their own places and families, they came to me.&nbsp; They 
offered to do this work (to make this road) for me as a free 
gift, without hire, without supplies, and I was tempted at first 
to refuse their offer.&nbsp; I knew the country to be poor; I 
knew famine threatening; I knew their families long disorganised 
for want of supervision.&nbsp; Yet I accepted, because I thought 
the lesson of that road might be more useful to Samoa than a 
thousand bread-fruit trees, and because to myself it was an 
exquisite pleasure to receive that which was so handsomely 
offered.&nbsp; It is now done; you have trod it to-day in coming 
hither.&nbsp; It has been made for me by chiefs; some of them 
old, some sick, all newly delivered from a harassing confinement,
and in spite of weather unusually hot and insalubrious.&nbsp; I 
have seen these chiefs labour valiantly with their own hands upon
the work, and I have set up over it, now that it is finished the 
name of &lsquo;The Road of Gratitude&rsquo; (the road of loving 
hearts), and the names of those that built it.&nbsp; &lsquo;In 
perpetuam memoriam,&rsquo; we say, and speak idly.&nbsp; At 
least, as long as my own life shall be spared it shall be here 
perpetuated; partly for my pleasure and in my gratitude; partly 
for others continually to publish the lesson of this 
road.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And turning to the chiefs, Mr Stevenson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I will tell you, chiefs, that when I saw 
you working on that road, my heart grew warm; not with gratitude 
only, but with hope.&nbsp; It seemed to me that I read the 
promise of something good for Samoa; it seemed to me as I looked 
at you that you were a company of warriors in a battle, fighting 
for the defence of our common country against all 
aggression.&nbsp; For there is a time to fight and a time to 
dig.&nbsp; You Samoans may fight, you may conquer twenty times, 
and thirty times, and all will be in vain.&nbsp; There is but one
way to defend Samoa.&nbsp; Hear it, before it is too late.&nbsp; 
It is to make roads and gardens, and care for your trees, and 
sell their produce wisely; and, in one word, to occupy and use 
your country.&nbsp; If you do not, others will. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love Samoa and her people.&nbsp; I love the 
land.&nbsp; I have chosen it to be my home while I live, and my 
grave after I am dead, and I love the people, and have chosen 
them to be my people, to live and die with.&nbsp; And I see that 
the day is come now of the great battle; of the great and the 
last opportunity by which it shall be decided whether you are to 
pass away like those other races of which I have been speaking, 
or to stand fast and have your children living on and honouring 
your memory in the land you received of your fathers.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr James H. Mulligan, U.S. Consul, told of the feast of 
Thanksgiving Day on the 29th November prior to Mr 
Stevenson&rsquo;s death, and how at great pains he had procured 
for it the necessary turkey, and how Mrs Stevenson had found a 
fair substitute for the pudding.&nbsp; In the course of his 
speech in reply to an unexpected proposal of &ldquo;The 
Host,&rdquo; Mr Stevenson said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There on my right sits she who has but 
lately from our own loved native land come back to me&mdash;she 
to whom, with no lessening of affection to those others to whom I
cling, I love better than all the world besides&mdash;my 
mother.&nbsp; From the opposite end of the table, my wife, who 
has been all in all to me, when the days were very dark, looks 
to-night into my eyes&mdash;while we have both grown a bit 
older&mdash;with undiminished and undiminishing affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Childless, yet on either side of me sits that good 
woman, my daughter, and the stalwart man, my son, and both have 
been and are more than son and daughter to me, and have brought 
into my life mirth and beauty.&nbsp; Nor is this all.&nbsp; There
sits the bright boy dear to my heart, full of the flow and the 
spirits of boyhood, so that I can even know that for a time at 
least we have still the voice of a child in the house.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr A. W. Mackay gives an account of the funeral and a 
description of the burial-place, ending:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Tofa Tusitala!&nbsp; Sleep peacefully! on 
thy mountain-top, alone in Nature&rsquo;s sanctity, where the 
wooddove&rsquo;s note, the moaning of the waves as they break 
unceasingly on the distant reef, and the sighing of the winds in 
the distant tavai trees chant their requiem.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Rev. Mr Clarke tells of the constant and active interest 
Mr Stevenson took in the missionaries and their work, often 
aiding them by his advice and fine insight into the character of 
the natives; and a translation follows of a dirge by one of the 
chiefs, so fine that we must give it:</p>
<blockquote><p>I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen, O this world, as I tell of the disaster<br />
That befell in the late afternoon;<br />
That broke like a wave of the sea<br />
Suddenly and swiftly, blinding our eyes.<br />
Alas for Loia who speaks tears in his voice!</p>
<p><i>Refrain</i>&mdash;Groan and weep, O my heart, in its 
sorrow.<br />
Alas for Tusitala, who rests in the forest!<br />
Aimlessly we wait, and sorrowing.&nbsp; Will he again return?<br 
/>
Lament, O Vailima, waiting and ever waiting!<br />
Let us search and inquire of the captain of ships,<br />
&lsquo;Be not angry, but has not Tusitala come?&rsquo;</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Teuila, sorrowing one, come thou hither!<br />
Prepare me a letter, and I will carry it.<br />
Let her Majesty Victoria be told<br />
That Tusitala, the loving one, has been taken hence.</p>
<p><i>Refrain</i>&mdash;Groan and weep, O my heart, etc., 
etc.</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! my heart weeps with anxious grief<br />
As I think of the days before us:<br />
Of the white men gathering for the Christmas assembly!<br />
Alas for Aolele! left in her loneliness,<br />
And the men of Vailima, who weep together<br />
Their leader&mdash;their leader being taken.</p>
<p><i>Refrain</i>&mdash;Groan and weep, O my heart, etc., 
etc.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! O my heart! it weeps unceasingly<br />
When I think of his illness<br />
Coming upon him with fatal swiftness.<br />
Would that it waited a glance or a word from him,<br />
Or some token, some token from us of our love.</p>
<p><i>Refrain</i>&mdash;Groan and weep, O my heart, etc., 
etc.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grieve, O my heart!&nbsp; I cannot bear to look on<br 
/>
All the chiefs who are there now assembling:<br />
Alas, Tusitala! Thou art not here!<br />
I look hither and thither in vain for thee.</p>
<p><i>Refrain</i>&mdash;Groan and weep, O my heart, etc., 
etc.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the little booklet closes with Mr Stevenson&rsquo;s own 
lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;REQUIEM.</p>
<p>Under the wide and starry sky,<br />
Dig the grave and let me lie;<br />
Glad did I live and gladly die,<br />
And I laid me down with a will.<br />
This be the verse you grave for me:<br />
&lsquo;Here he lies where he longed to be;<br />
Home is the sailor, home from sea;<br />
And the hunter home from the hill.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every touch tells here was a man, with heart and head, with 
soul and mind intent on the loftiest things; simple, great,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Like one of the simple great ones gone<br 
/>
For ever and ever by.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His character towered after all far above his books; great and
beautiful though they were.&nbsp; Ready for friendship; from all 
meanness free.&nbsp; So, too, the Samoans felt.&nbsp; This, 
surely, was what Goethe meant when he wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The clear head and stout heart,<br />
However far they roam,<br />
Yet in every truth have part,<br />
Are everywhere at home.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>His manliness, his width of sympathy, his practicality, his 
range of interests were in nothing more seen than in his 
contributions to the history of Samoa, as specially exhibited in 
<i>A Footnote to History</i> and his letters to the 
<i>Times</i>.&nbsp; He was, on this side, in no sense a dreamer, 
but a man of acute observation and quick eye for passing events 
and the characters that were in them with sympathy equal to his 
discernments.&nbsp; His portraits of certain Germans and others 
in these writings, and his power of tracing effects to remote and
underlying causes, show sufficiently what he might have done in 
the field of history, had not higher voices called him.&nbsp; His
adaptation to the life in Samoa, and his assumption of the 
semi-patriarchal character in his own sphere there, were only 
tokens of the presence of the same traits as have just been dwelt
on.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI&mdash;MISS STUBBS&rsquo; RECORD OF A 
PILGRIMAGE</h2>
<p>Mrs Strong, in her chapter of <i>Table Talk in Memories of 
Vailima</i>, tells a story of the natives&rsquo; love for 
Stevenson.&nbsp; &ldquo;The other day the cook was away,&rdquo; 
she writes, &ldquo;and Louis, who was busy writing, took his 
meals in his room.&nbsp; Knowing there was no one to cook his 
lunch, he told Sosimo to bring him some bread and cheese.&nbsp; 
To his surprise he was served with an excellent meal&mdash;an 
omelette, a good salad, and perfect coffee.&nbsp; &lsquo;Who 
cooked this?&rsquo; asked Louis in Samoan.&nbsp; &lsquo;I 
did,&rsquo; said Sosimo.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Louis, 
&lsquo;great is your wisdom.&rsquo;&nbsp; Sosimo bowed and 
corrected him&mdash;&lsquo;Great is my love!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Stubbs, in her <i>Stevenson&rsquo;s Shrine</i>; <i>the 
Record of a Pilgrimage</i>, illustrates the same devotion.&nbsp; 
On the top of Mount Vaea, she writes, is the massive sarcophagus,
&ldquo;not an ideal structure by any means, not even beautiful, 
and yet in its massive ruggedness it somehow suited the man and 
the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wind sighed softly in the branches of the 
&lsquo;Tavau&rsquo; trees, from out the green recesses of the 
&lsquo;Toi&rsquo; came the plaintive coo of the 
wood-pigeon.&nbsp; In and out of the branches of the magnificent 
&lsquo;Fau&rsquo; tree, which overhangs the grave, a king-fisher,
sea-blue, iridescent, flitted to and fro, whilst a scarlet 
hibiscus, in full flower, showed up royally against the gray 
lichened cement.&nbsp; All around was light and life and colour, 
and I said to myself, &lsquo;He is made one with nature&rsquo;; 
he is now, body and soul and spirit, commingled with the 
loveliness around.&nbsp; He who longed in life to scale the 
height, he who attained his wish only in death, has become in 
himself a parable of fulfilment.&nbsp; No need now for that 
heart-sick cry:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sing me a song of a lad that is 
gone,<br />
Say, could that lad be I?&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No need now for the despairing finality of:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I have trod the upward and the 
downward slope,<br />
I have endured and done in the days of yore,<br />
I have longed for all, and bid farewell to hope,<br />
And I have lived, and loved, and closed the door.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death has set his seal of peace on the unequal conflict
of mind and matter; the All-Mother has gathered him to 
herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In years to come, when his grave is perchance 
forgotten, a rugged ruin, home of the lizard and the bat, 
Tusitala&mdash;the story-teller&mdash;&lsquo;the man with a heart
of gold&rsquo; (as I so often heard him designated in the 
Islands), will live, when it may be his tales have ceased to 
interest, in the tender remembrance of those whose lives he 
beautified, and whose hearts he warmed into gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The chiefs have prohibited the use of firearms or other 
weapons on Mount Vaea, &ldquo;in order that the birds may live 
there undisturbed and unafraid, and build their nests in the 
trees around Tusitala&rsquo;s grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Stubbs has many records of the impression produced on 
those he came in contact with in Samoa&mdash;white men and women 
as well as natives.&nbsp; She met a certain Austrian Count, who 
adored Stevenson&rsquo;s memory.&nbsp; Over his camp bed was a 
framed photograph of R. L. Stevenson.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I keep him 
there, for he was my saviour, and I wish &lsquo;good-night&rsquo;
and &lsquo;good-morning,&rsquo; every day, both to himself and to
his old home.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Count then told us that when he 
was stopping at Vailima he used to have his bath daily on the 
verandah below his room.&nbsp; One lovely morning he got up very 
early, got into the bath, and splashed and sang, feeling very 
well and very happy, and at last beginning to sing very loudly, 
he forgot Mr Stevenson altogether.&nbsp; All at once there was 
Stevenson himself, his hair all ruffled up, his eyes full of 
anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;Man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you and your 
infernal row have cost me more than two hundred pounds in 
ideas,&rdquo; and with that he was gone, but he did not address 
the Count again the whole of that day.&nbsp; Next morning he had 
forgotten the Count&rsquo;s offence and was just as friendly as 
ever, but&mdash;the noise was never repeated!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another of the Count&rsquo;s stories greatly amused the 
visitors:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An English lord came all the way to Samoa 
in his yacht to see Mr Stevenson, and found him in his cool 
Kimino sitting with the ladies, and drinking tea on his verandah;
the whole party had their feet bare.&nbsp; The English lord 
thought that he must have called at the wrong time, and offered 
to go away, but Mr Stevenson called out to him, and brought him 
back, and made him stay to dinner.&nbsp; They all went away to 
dress, and the guest was left sitting alone in the 
verandah.&nbsp; Soon they came back, Mr Osbourne and Mr Stevenson
wearing the form of dress most usual in that hot climate a white 
mess jacket, and white trousers, but their feet were still 
bare.&nbsp; The guest put up his eyeglass and stared for a bit, 
then he looked down upon his own beautifully shod feet, and 
sighed.&nbsp; They all talked and laughed until the ladies came 
in, the ladies in silk dresses, befrilled with lace, but still 
with bare feet, and the guest took a covert look through his 
eyeglass and gasped, but when he noticed that there were gold 
bangles on Mrs Strong&rsquo;s ankles and rings upon her toes, he 
could bear no more and dropped his eyeglass on the ground of the 
verandah breaking it all to bits.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miss Stubbs met on the other side of the island a photographer
who told her this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I had but recently come to Samoa,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and was standing one day in my shop when Mr 
Stevenson came in and spoke.&nbsp; &lsquo;Man,&rsquo; he said, 
&lsquo;I tak ye to be a Scotsman like mysel&rsquo;.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would I could have claimed a kinship,&rdquo; deplored
the photographer, &ldquo;but, alas!&nbsp; I am English to the 
backbone, with never a drop of Scotch blood in my veins, and I 
told him this, regretting the absence of the blood 
tie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I could have sworn your back was the back of a 
Scotsman,&rsquo; was his comment, &lsquo;but,&rsquo; and he held 
out his hand, &lsquo;you look sick, and there is a fellowship in 
sickness not to be denied.&rsquo; I said I was not strong, and 
had come to the Island on account of my health.&nbsp; 
&lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; replied Mr Stevenson, &lsquo;it shall 
be my business to help you to get well; come to Vailima whenever 
you like, and if I am out, ask for refreshment, and wait until I 
come in, you will always find a welcome there.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this point my informant turned away, and there was a break 
in his voice as he exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah, the years go on, and I 
don&rsquo;t miss him less, but more; next to my mother he was the
best friend I ever had: a man with a heart of gold; his house was
a second home to me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stevenson&rsquo;s experience shows how easy it is with a 
certain type of man, to restore the old feudal conditions of 
service and relationship.&nbsp; Stevenson did this in essentials 
in Samoa.&nbsp; He tells us how he managed to get good service 
out of the Samoans (who are accredited with great unwillingness 
to work); and this he <i>did</i> by firm, but generous, kindly, 
almost brotherly treatment, reviving, as it were, a kind of clan 
life&mdash;giving a livery of certain colours&mdash;symbol of all
this.&nbsp; A little fellow of eight, he tells, had been taken 
into the household, made a pet of by Mrs Strong, his 
stepdaughter, and had had a dress given to him, like that of the 
men; and, when one day he had strolled down by himself as far as 
the hotel, and the master of it, seeing him, called out in 
Samoan, &ldquo;Hi, youngster, who are you?&rdquo;&nbsp; The 
eight-year-old replied, &ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see for 
yourself?&nbsp; I am one of the Vailima men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The story of the <i>Road of the Loving Heart</i> was but 
another fine attestation of it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII&mdash;HIS GENIUS AND METHODS</h2>
<p>To have created a school of idolaters, who will out and out 
swear by everything, and as though by necessity, at the same 
time, a school of studious detractors, who will suspiciously 
question everything, or throw out suggestions of disparagement, 
is at all events, a proof of greatness, the countersign of 
undoubted genius, and an assurance of lasting fame.&nbsp; R. L. 
Stevenson has certainly secured this.&nbsp; Time will tell what 
of virtue there is with either party.&nbsp; For me, who knew 
Stevenson, and loved him, as finding in the sweet-tempered, 
brave, and in some things, most generous man, what gave at once 
tone and elevation to the artist, I would fain indicate here my 
impressions of him and his genius&mdash;impressions that remain 
almost wholly uninfluenced by the vast mass of matter about him 
that the press now turns out.&nbsp; Books, not to speak of 
articles, pour forth about him&mdash;about his style, his art, 
his humour and his characters&mdash;aye, and even about his 
religion.</p>
<p>Miss Simpson follows Mr Bellyse Baildon with the <i>Edinburgh 
Days</i>, Miss Moyes Black comes on with her picture in the 
<i>Famous Scots</i>, and Professor Raleigh succeeds her; Mr 
Graham Balfour follows with his<i> Life</i>; Mr Kelman&rsquo;s 
volume about his Religion comes next, and that is reinforced by 
more familiar letters and <i>Table Talk</i>, by Lloyd Osbourne 
and Mrs Strong, his step-children; Mr J. Hammerton then comes on 
handily with <i>Stevensoniana</i>&mdash;fruit lovingly gathered 
from many and far fields, and garnered with not a little tact and
taste, and catholicity; Miss Laura Stubbs then presents us with 
her touching <i>Stevenson&rsquo;s Shrine</i>: <i>the Record of a 
Pilgrimage</i>; and Mr Sidney Colvin is now busily at work on his
<i>Life of Stevenson</i>, which must do not a little to enlighten
and to settle many questions.</p>
<p>Curiosity and interest grow as time passes; and the places 
connected with Stevenson, hitherto obscure many of them, are now 
touched with light if not with romance, and are known, by name at
all events, to every reader of books.&nbsp; Yes; every place he 
lived in, or touched at, is worthy of full description if only on
account of its associations with him.&nbsp; If there is not a 
land of Stevenson, as there is a land of Scott, or of Burns, it 
is due to the fact that he was far-travelled, and in his works 
painted many scenes: but there are at home&mdash;Edinburgh, and 
Halkerside and Allermuir, Caerketton, Swanston, and Colinton, and
Maw Moss and Rullion Green and Tummel, &ldquo;the <i>wale</i> of 
Scotland,&rdquo; as he named it to me, and the Castletown of 
Braemar&mdash;Braemar in his view coming a good second to Tummel,
for starting-points to any curious worshipper who would go the 
round in Scotland and miss nothing.&nbsp; Mr Geddie&rsquo;s work 
on <i>The Home Country of Stevenson</i> may be found very helpful
here.</p>
<p>1. It is impossible to separate Stevenson from his work, 
because of the imperious personal element in it; and so I shall 
not now strive to gain the appearance of cleverness by affecting 
any distinction here.&nbsp; The first thing I would say is, that 
he was when I knew him&mdash;what pretty much to the end he 
remained&mdash;a youth.&nbsp; His outlook on life was boyishly 
genial and free, despite all his sufferings from 
ill-health&mdash;it was the pride of action, the joy of 
endurance, the revelry of high spirits, and the sense of victory 
that most fascinated him; and his theory of life was to take 
pleasure and give pleasure, without calculation or stint&mdash;a 
kind of boyish grace and bounty never to be overcome or disturbed
by outer accident or change.&nbsp; If he was sometimes haunted 
with the thought of changes through changed conditions or 
circumstances, as my very old friend, Mr Charles Lowe, has told 
even of the College days that he was always supposing things to 
undergo some sea-change into something else, if not &ldquo;into 
something rich and strange,&rdquo; this was but to add to his 
sense of enjoyment, and the power of conferring delight, and the 
luxuries of variety, as boys do when they let fancy loose.&nbsp; 
And this always had, with him, an individual reference or 
return.&nbsp; He was thus constantly, and latterly, 
half-consciously, trying to interpret himself somehow through all
the things which engaged him, and which he so 
transmogrified&mdash;things that especially attracted him and 
took his fancy.&nbsp; Thus, if it must be confessed, that even in
his highest moments, there lingers a touch&mdash;if no more than 
a touch&mdash;of self-consciousness which will not allow him to 
forget manner in matter, it is also true that he is cunningly 
conveying traits in himself; and the sense of this is often at 
the root of his sweet, gentle, na&iuml;ve humour.&nbsp; There is,
therefore, some truth in the criticisms which assert that even 
&ldquo;long John Silver,&rdquo; that fine pirate, with his one 
leg, was, after all, a shadow of Stevenson himself&mdash;the 
genial buccaneer who did his tremendous murdering with a smile on
his face was but Stevenson thrown into new circumstances, or, as 
one has said, Stevenson-cum-Henley, so thrown as was also Archer 
in <i>Weir of Hermiston</i>, and more than this, that his most 
successful women-folk&mdash;like Miss Grant and 
Catriona&mdash;are studies of himself, and that in all his 
heroes, and even heroines, was an unmistakable touch of R. L. 
Stevenson.&nbsp; Even Mr Baildon rather maladroitly admits that 
in Miss Grant, the Lord Advocate&rsquo;s daughter, <i>there is a 
good deal of the author himself disguised in 
petticoats</i>.&nbsp; I have thought of Stevenson in many suits, 
beside that which included the velvet jacket, 
but&mdash;petticoats!</p>
<p>Youth is autocratic, and can show a grand indifferency: it 
goes for what it likes, and ignores all else&mdash;it fondly 
magnifies its favourites, and, after all, to a great extent, it 
is but analysing, dealing with and presenting itself to us, if we
only watch well.&nbsp; This is the secret of all prevailing 
romance: it is the secret of all stories of adventure and 
chivalry of the simpler and more primitive order; and in one 
aspect it is true that R. L. Stevenson loved and clung to the 
primitive and elemental, if it may not be said, as one 
distinguished writer has said, that he even loved savagery in 
itself.&nbsp; But hardly could it be seriously held, as Mr I. 
Zangwill held:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That women did not cut any figure in his 
books springs from this same interest in the elemental.&nbsp; 
Women are not born, but made.&nbsp; They are a social product of 
infinite complexity and delicacy.&nbsp; For a like reason 
Stevenson was no interpreter of the modern. . . . A child to the 
end, always playing at &lsquo;make-believe,&rsquo; dying young, 
as those whom the gods love, and, as he would have died had he 
achieved his centenary, he was the natural exponent in literature
of the child.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But there were subtly qualifying elements beyond what Mr 
Zangwill here recognises and reinforces.&nbsp; That is just about
as correct and true as this other deliverance:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;His Scotch romances have been as 
over-praised by the zealous Scotsmen who cry &lsquo;genius&rsquo;
at the sight of a kilt, and who lose their heads at a waft from 
the heather, as his other books have been under-praised.&nbsp; 
The best of all, <i>The Master of Ballantrae</i>, ends in a bog; 
and where the author aspires to exceptional subtlety of 
character-drawing he befogs us or himself altogether.&nbsp; We 
are so long weighing the brothers Ballantrae in the balance, 
watching it incline now this way, now that, scrupulously removing
a particle of our sympathy from the one brother to the other, to 
restore it again in the next chapter, that we end with a 
conception of them as confusing as Mr Gilbert&rsquo;s conception 
of Hamlet, who was idiotically sane with lucid intervals of 
lunacy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Stevenson was, as Mr Zangwill holds, &ldquo;the child to 
the end,&rdquo; and the child only, then if we may not say what 
Carlyle said of De Quincey: &ldquo;<i>Eccovi</i>, that child has 
been in hell,&rdquo; we may say, &ldquo;<i>Eccovi</i>, that child
has been in unchildlike haunts, and can&rsquo;t forget the memory
of them.&rdquo;&nbsp; In a sense every romancer is a 
child&mdash;such was Ludwig Tieck, such was Scott, such was James
Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd.&nbsp; But each is something 
more&mdash;he has been touched with the wand of a fairy, and 
knows, at least, some of Elfin Land as well as of 
childhood&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>The sense of Stevenson&rsquo;s youthfulness seems to have 
struck every one who had intimacy with him.&nbsp; Mr Baildon 
writes (p. 21 of his book):</p>
<blockquote><p>I would now give much to possess but one of 
Stevenson&rsquo;s gifts&mdash;namely, that extraordinary 
vividness of recollection by which he could so astonishingly 
recall, not only the doings, but the very thoughts and emotions 
of his youth.&nbsp; For, often as we must have communed together,
with all the shameless candour of boys, hardly any remark has 
stuck to me except the opinion already alluded to, which struck 
me&mdash;his elder by some fifteen months&mdash;as very amusing, 
that at sixteen &lsquo;we should be men.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>He of 
all mortals</i>, <i>who was</i>, <i>in a sense</i>, <i>always 
still a boy</i>!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Gosse tells us:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He had retained a great deal of the 
temperament of a child, and it was his philosophy to encourage 
it.&nbsp; In his dreary passages of bed, when his illness was 
more than commonly heavy on him, he used to contrive little 
amusements for himself.&nbsp; He played on the flute, or he 
modelled little groups and figures in clay.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2. One of the qualifying elements unnoted by Mr Zangwill is 
simply this, that R. L. Stevenson never lost the strange tint 
imparted to his youth by the religious influences to which he was
subject, and which left their impress and colour on him and all 
that he did.&nbsp; Henley, in his striking sonnet, hit it when he
wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A deal of Ariel, just a streak of Puck,<br 
/>
Much Antony, of Hamlet most of all,<br />
<i>And something of the Shorter Catechist</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Something</i>! he was a great deal of Shorter 
Catechist!&nbsp; Scotch Calvinism, its metaphysic, and all the 
strange whims, perversities, and questionings of &ldquo;Fate, 
free-will, foreknowledge absolute,&rdquo; which it inevitably 
awakens, was much with him&mdash;the sense of reprobation and the
gloom born of it, as well as the abounding joy in the sense of 
the elect&mdash;the Covenanters and their wild resolutions, the 
moss-troopers and their dare-devilries&mdash;Pentland Risings and
fights of Rullion Green; he not only never forgot them, but they 
mixed themselves as in his very breath of life, and made him a 
great questioner.&nbsp; How would I have borne myself in this or 
in that?&nbsp; Supposing I had been there, how would it have 
been&mdash;the same, or different from what it was with those 
that were there?&nbsp; His work is throughout at bottom a series 
of problems that almost all trace to this root, directly or 
indirectly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There, but for the grace of God, goes 
John Bradford,&rdquo; said the famous Puritan on seeing a felon 
led to execution; so with Stevenson.&nbsp; Hence his fondness for
tramps, for scamps (he even bestowed special attention and pains 
on Villon, the poet-scamp); he was rather impatient with poor 
Thoreau, because he was a purist solitary, and had too little of 
vice, and, as Stevenson held, narrow in sympathy, and too 
self-satisfied, and bent only on self-improvement.&nbsp; He held 
a brief for the honest villain, and leaned to him 
brotherly.&nbsp; Even the anecdotes he most prizes have a fine 
look this way&mdash;a hunger for completion in achievement, even 
in the violation of fine humane feeling or morality, and all the 
time a sense of submission to God&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; said the dying gravedigger in <i>Old 
Mortality</i>, &ldquo;I hae laid three hunner an&rsquo; fower 
score in that kirkyaird, an&rsquo; had it been His wull,&rdquo; 
indicating Heaven, &ldquo;I wad hae likeit weel to hae made oot 
the fower hunner.&rdquo;&nbsp; That took Stevenson.&nbsp; Listen 
to what Mr Edmond Gosse tells of his talk, when he found him in a
private hotel in Finsbury Circus, London, ready to be put on 
board a steamer for America, on 21st August, 1887:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It was church time, and there was some talk
of my witnessing his will, which I could not do because there 
could be found no other reputable witness, the whole crew of the 
hotel being at church.&nbsp; &lsquo;This,&rsquo; he said, 
&lsquo;is the way in which our valuable city hotels&mdash;packed 
no doubt with gems and jewellery&mdash;are deserted on a Sunday 
morning.&nbsp; Some bold piratical fellow, defying the spirit of 
Sabbatarianism, might make a handsome revenue by sacking the 
derelict hotels between the hours of ten and twelve.&nbsp; One 
hotel a week would enable such a man to retire in course of a 
year.&nbsp; A mask might perhaps be worn for the mere fancy of 
the thing, and to terrify kitchen-maids, but no real disguise 
would be needful.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would rather agree with Mr Chesterton than with Mr Zangwill 
here:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Stevenson&rsquo;s enormous capacity for joy
flowed directly out of his profoundly religious 
temperament.&nbsp; He conceived himself as an unimportant guest 
at one eternal and uproarious banquet, and instead of grumbling 
at the soup, he accepted it with careless gratitude. . . . His 
gaiety was neither the gaiety of the pagan, nor the gaiety of the
<i>bon vivant</i>.&nbsp; It was the greater gaiety of the 
mystic.&nbsp; He could enjoy trifles because there was to him no 
such thing as a trifle.&nbsp; He was a child who respected his 
dolls because they were the images of the image of God, portraits
at only two removes.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, then, we have the child crossed by the dreamer and the 
mystic, bred of Calvinism and speculation on human fate and 
chance, and on the mystery of temperament and inheritance, and 
all that flows from these&mdash;reprobation, with its dire 
shadows, assured Election with its joys, etc., etc.</p>
<p>3. If such a combination is in favour of the story-teller up 
to a certain point, it is not favourable to the highest flights, 
and it is alien to dramatic presentation pure and simple.&nbsp; 
This implies detachment from moods and characters, high as well 
as low, that complete justice in presentation may be done to all 
alike, and the one balance that obtains in life grasped and 
repeated with emphasis.&nbsp; But towards his leading characters 
Stevenson is unconsciously biassed, because they are more or less
shadowy projections of himself, or images through which he would 
reveal one or other side or aspect of his own personality.&nbsp; 
Attwater is a confessed failure, because it, more than any other,
testifies this: he is but a mouth-piece for one side or tendency 
in Stevenson.&nbsp; If the same thing is not more decisively felt
in some other cases, it is because Stevenson there showed the 
better art o&rsquo; hidin&rsquo;, and not because he was any more
truly detached or dramatic.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of Hamlet most of 
all,&rdquo; wrote Henley in his sonnet.&nbsp; The Hamlet in 
Stevenson&mdash;the self-questioning, egotistic, moralising 
Hamlet&mdash;was, and to the end remained, a something alien to 
bold, dramatic, creative freedom.&nbsp; He is great as an artist,
as a man bent on giving to all that he did the best and most 
distinguished form possible, but not great as a free creator of 
dramatic power.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said as a mere 
child, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve drawed a man.&nbsp; Now, will I draw his
soul?&rdquo;&nbsp; He was to the end all too fond to essay a 
picture of the soul, separate and peculiar.&nbsp; All the Jekyll 
and Hyde and even Ballantrae conceptions came out of 
that&mdash;and what is more, he always mixed his own soul with 
the other soul, and could not help doing so.</p>
<p>4. When; therefore, I find Mr Pinero, in lecturing at 
Edinburgh, deciding in favour of Stevenson as possessed of rare 
dramatic power, and wondering why he did not more effectively 
employ it, I can&rsquo;t agree with him; and this because of the 
presence of a certain atmosphere in the novels, alien to free 
play of the individualities presented.&nbsp; Like 
Hawthorne&rsquo;s, like the works of our great symbolists, they 
are restricted by a sense of some obtaining conception, some 
weird metaphysical <i>weird</i> or preconception.&nbsp; This is 
the ground &ldquo;Ian MacLaren&rdquo; has for saying that 
&ldquo;his kinship is not with Boccaccio and Rabelais, but with 
Dante and Spenser&rdquo;&mdash;the ground for many remarks by 
critics to the effect that they still crave from him &ldquo;less 
symbol and more individuality&rdquo;&mdash;the ground for the 
Rev. W. J. Dawson&rsquo;s remark that &ldquo;he has a powerful 
and persistent sense of the spiritual forces which move behind 
the painted shows of life; that he writes not only as a realist 
but as a prophet, his meanest stage being set with eternity as a 
background.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such expressions are fullest justification for what we have 
here said: it adds, and can only add, to our admiration of 
Stevenson, as a thinker, seer, or mystic, but the asserting sense
of such power can only end in lessening the height to which he 
could attain as a dramatic artist; and there is much indeed 
against Mr Pinero&rsquo;s own view that, in the dramas, he finds 
that &ldquo;fine speeches&rdquo; are ruinous to them as acting 
plays.&nbsp; In the strict sense overfine speeches are yet almost
everywhere.&nbsp; David Balfour could never have writ some 
speeches attributed to him&mdash;they are just R. L. Stevenson 
with a very superficial difference that, when once detected, 
renders them curious and quaint and interesting, but not 
dramatic.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII&mdash;PREACHER AND MYSTIC FABULIST</h2>
<p>In reality, Stevenson is always directly or indirectly 
preaching a sermon&mdash;enforcing a moral&mdash;as though he 
could not help it.&nbsp; &ldquo;He would rise from the dead to 
preach a sermon.&rdquo;&nbsp; He wrote some first-rate fables, 
and might indeed have figured to effect as a moralist-fabulist, 
as truly he was from beginning to end.&nbsp; There was a bit of 
Bunyan in him as well as of &AElig;sop and Rousseau and 
Thoreau&mdash;the mixture that found coherency in his most 
peculiarly patient and forbearing temper is what gives at once 
the quaintness, the freedom, and yet the odd didactic something 
that is never wanting.&nbsp; I remember a fable about the Devil 
that might well be brought in to illustrate this 
here&mdash;careful readers who neglect nothing that Stevenson 
wrote will remember it also and perhaps bear me out here.</p>
<p>But for the sake of the young folks who may yet have some 
leeway to make up, I shall indulge myself a little by quoting it:
and, since I am on that tack, follow it by another which presents
Stevenson in his favourite guise of quizzing his own characters, 
if not for his own advantage certainly for ours, if we would in 
the least understand the fine moralist-casuistical qualities of 
his mind and fancy:</p>
<blockquote><p>THE DEVIL AND THE INNKEEPER</p>
<p>Once upon a time the devil stayed at an inn, where no one knew
him, for they were people whose education had been 
neglected.&nbsp; He was bent on mischief, and for a time kept 
everybody by the ears.&nbsp; But at last the innkeeper set a 
watch upon the devil and took him in the act.</p>
<p>The innkeeper got a rope&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I am going to thrash you,&rdquo; said the 
inn-keeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no right to be angry with me,&rdquo; said the 
devil.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am only the devil, and it is my nature to 
do wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo; asked the innkeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact, I assure you,&rdquo; said the devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You really cannot help doing ill?&rdquo; asked the 
innkeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the smallest,&rdquo; said the devil, &ldquo;it 
would be useless cruelty to thrash a thing like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would indeed,&rdquo; said the innkeeper.</p>
<p>And he made a noose and hanged the devil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; said the innkeeper.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The deeper Stevenson goes, the more happily is he 
inspired.&nbsp; We could scarcely cite anything more 
Stevensonian, alike in its humour and its philosophy, than the 
dialogue between Captain Smollett and Long John Silver, entitled 
<i>The Persons of the Tale</i>.&nbsp; After chapter xxxii. of 
<i>Treasure Island</i>, these two puppets &ldquo;strolled out to 
have a pipe before business should begin again, and met in an 
open space not far from the story.&rdquo;&nbsp; After a few 
preliminaries:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a damned rogue, my man,&rdquo;
said the Captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Cap&rsquo;n, be just,&rdquo; returned the 
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no call to be angry with me in 
earnest.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m on&rsquo;y a character in a sea 
story.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t really exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t really exist either,&rdquo; says 
the Captain, &ldquo;which seems to meet that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t set no limits to what a virtuous 
character might consider argument,&rdquo; responded Silver.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m the villain of the tale, I am; and speaking 
as one seafaring man to another, what I want to know is, 
what&rsquo;s the odds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you never taught your catechism?&rdquo; said the 
Captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know there&rsquo;s such a 
thing as an Author?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a thing as a Author?&rdquo; returned John, 
derisively.&nbsp; &ldquo;And who better&rsquo;n me?&nbsp; And the
p&rsquo;int is, if the Author made you, he made Long John, and he
made Hands, and Pew, and George Merry&mdash;not that George is up
to much, for he&rsquo;s little more&rsquo;n a name; and he made 
Flint, what there is of him; and he made this here mutiny, you 
keep such a work about; and he had Tom Redruth shot; 
and&mdash;well, if that&rsquo;s a Author, give me Pew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe in a future state?&rdquo; said 
Smollett.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think there&rsquo;s nothing but the
present sorty-paper?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t rightly know for that,&rdquo; said 
Silver, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t see what it&rsquo;s got to do 
with it, anyway.&nbsp; What I know is this: if there is sich a 
thing as a Author, I&rsquo;m his favourite chara&rsquo;ter.&nbsp;
He does me fathoms better&rsquo;n he does you&mdash;fathoms, he 
does.&nbsp; And he likes doing me.&nbsp; He keeps me on deck 
mostly all the time, crutch and all; and he leaves you measling 
in the hold, where nobody can&rsquo;t see you, nor wants to, and 
you may lay to that!&nbsp; If there is a Author, by thunder, but 
he&rsquo;s on my side, and you may lay to it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see he&rsquo;s giving you a long rope,&rdquo; said 
the Captain. . . .</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stevenson&rsquo;s stories&mdash;one and all&mdash;are too 
closely the illustrations by characters of which his essays 
furnish the texts.&nbsp; You shall not read the one wholly apart 
from the other without losing something&mdash;without losing much
of the quaint, often childish, and always insinuating personality
of the writer.&nbsp; It is this if fully perceived which would 
justify one writer, Mr Zangwill, if I don&rsquo;t forget, in 
saying, as he did say, that Stevenson would hold his place by his
essays and not by his novels.&nbsp; Hence there is a unity in 
all, but a unity found in a root which is ultimately inimical to 
what is strictly free dramatic creation&mdash;creation, broad, 
natural and unmoral in the highest sense just as nature is, as it
is to us, for example, when we speak of Shakespeare, or even 
Scott, or of Cervantes or Fielding.&nbsp; If Mr Henley in his 
irruptive if not spiteful <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i> article had 
made this clear from the high critical ground, then some of his 
derogatory remarks would not have been quite so personal and 
offensive as they are.</p>
<p>Stevenson&rsquo;s bohemianism was always restrained and 
coloured by this.&nbsp; He is a casuistic moralist, if not a 
Shorter Catechist, as Mr Henley put it in his clever 
sonnet.&nbsp; He is constantly asking himself about moral laws 
and how they work themselves out in character, especially as 
these suggest and involve the casuistries of human nature.&nbsp; 
He is often a little like Nathaniel Hawthorne, but he hardly 
follows them far enough and rests on his own preconceptions and 
predilections, only he does not, like him, get into or remain 
long in the cobwebby corners&mdash;his love of the open air and 
exercise derived from generations of active lighthouse engineers,
out at all times on sea or land, or from Scottish ministers who 
were fond of composing their sermons and reflecting on the 
backwardness of human nature as they walked in their gardens or 
along the hillsides even among mists and storms, did something to
save him here, reinforcing natural cheerfulness and the warm 
desire to give pleasure.&nbsp; His excessive elaboration of 
style, which grew upon him more and more, giving throughout often
a sense of extreme artificiality and of the self-consciousness 
usually bred of it, is but another incidental proof of 
this.&nbsp; And let no reader think that I wish here to decry R. 
L. Stevenson.&nbsp; I only desire faithfully to try to understand
him, and to indicate the class or group to which his genius and 
temperament really belong.&nbsp; He is from first to last the 
idealistic dreamy or mystical romancer, and not the true idealist
or dealer direct with life or character for its own sake.&nbsp; 
The very beauty and sweetness of his spirit in one way militated 
against his dramatic success&mdash;he really did not believe in 
villains, and always made them better than they should have been,
and that, too, on the very side where wickedness&mdash;their 
natural wickedness&mdash;is most available&mdash;on the 
stage.&nbsp; The dreamer of dreams and the Shorter Catechist, 
strangely united together, were here directly at odds with the 
creative power, and crossed and misdirected it, and the casuist 
came in and manoeuvred the limelight&mdash;all too like the old 
devil of the mediaeval drama, who was made only to be laughed at 
and taken lightly, a buffoon and a laughing-stock indeed.&nbsp; 
And while he could unveil villainy, as is the case pre-eminently 
in Huish in the <i>Ebb-Tide</i>, he shrank from inflicting the 
punishments for which untutored human nature looks, and thus he 
lost one great aid to crude dramatic effect.&nbsp; As to his 
poems, they are intimately personal in his happiest moments: he 
deals with separate moods and sentiments, and scarcely ever 
touches those of a type alien to his own.&nbsp; The defect of his
child poems is distinctly that he is everywhere strictly 
recalling and reproducing his own quaint and wholly exceptional 
childhood; and children, ordinary, normal, healthy children, will
not take to these poems (though grown-ups largely do so), as they
would to, say, the <i>Lilliput Lev&eacute;e</i> of my old friend,
W. B. Rands.&nbsp; Rands showed a great deal of true dramatic 
play there within his own very narrow limits, as, at all events, 
adults must conceive them.</p>
<p>Even in his greatest works, in <i>The Master of Ballantrae</i>
and <i>Weir of Hermiston</i>, the special power in Stevenson 
really lies in subduing his characters at the most critical point
for action, to make them prove or sustain his thesis; and in this
way the rare effect that he might have secured 
<i>dramatically</i> is largely lost and make-believe substituted,
as in the Treasure Search in the end of <i>The Master of 
Ballantrae</i>.&nbsp; The powerful dramatic effect he might have 
had in his <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> is thus completely 
sacrificed.&nbsp; The essence of the drama for the stage is that 
the work is for this and this alone&mdash;dialogue and everything
being only worked rightly when it bears on, aids, and finally 
secures this in happy completeness.</p>
<p>In a word, you always, in view of true dramatic effect, see 
Stevenson himself too clearly behind his characters.&nbsp; The 
&ldquo;fine speeches&rdquo; Mr Pinero referred to trace to the 
intrusion behind the glass of a part-quicksilvered portion, which
cunningly shows, when the glass is moved about, Stevenson himself
behind the character, as we have said already.&nbsp; For long he 
shied dealing with women, as though by a true instinct.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately for him his image was as clear behind 
<i>Catriona</i>, with the discerning, as anywhere else; and this,
alas! too far undid her as an independent, individual character, 
though traits like those in her author were attractive.&nbsp; The
constant effort to relieve the sense of this affords him the most
admirable openings for the display of his exquisite style, of 
which he seldom or never fails to make the very most in this 
regard; but the necessity laid upon him to aim at securing a 
sense of relief by this is precisely the same as led him to write
the overfine speeches in the plays, as Mr Pinero found and 
pointed out at Edinburgh: both defeat the true end, but in the 
written book mere art of style and a na&iuml;vete and a certain 
sweetness of temper conceal the lack of nature and creative 
spontaneity; while on the stage the descriptions, saving 
reflections and fine asides, are ruthlessly cut away under sheer 
stage necessities, or, if left, but hinder the action; and art of
this kind does not there suffice to conceal the lack of 
nature.</p>
<p>More clearly to bring out my meaning here and draw aid from 
comparative illustration, let me take my old friend of many 
years, Charles Gibbon.&nbsp; Gibbon was poor, very poor, in 
intellectual subtlety compared with Stevenson; he had none of his
sweet, quaint, original fancy; he was no casuist; he was utterly 
void of power in the subdued humorous twinkle or genial by-play 
in which Stevenson excelled.&nbsp; But he has more of dramatic 
power, pure and simple, than Stevenson had&mdash;his 
novels&mdash;the best of them&mdash;would far more easily yield 
themselves to the ordinary purposes of the ordinary 
playwright.&nbsp; Along with conscientiousness, perception, 
penetration, with the dramatist must go a certain indescribable 
common-sense commonplaceness&mdash;if I may name it 
so&mdash;protection against vagary and that over-refined egotism 
and self-confession which is inimical to the drama and in which 
the Stevensonian type all too largely abounds for successful 
dramatic production.&nbsp; Mr Henley perhaps put it too strongly 
when he said that what was supremely of interest to R. L. 
Stevenson was Stevenson himself; but he indicates the tendency, 
and that tendency is inimical to strong, broad, effective and 
varied dramatic presentation.&nbsp; Water cannot rise above its 
own level; nor can minds of this type go freely out of themselves
in a grandly healthy, unconscious, and unaffected way, and this 
is the secret of the dramatic spirit, if it be not, as Shelley 
said, the secret of morals, which Stevenson, when he passed away,
was but on the way to attain.&nbsp; As we shall see, he had risen
so far above it, subdued it, triumphed over it, that we really 
cannot guess what he might have attained had but more years been 
given him.&nbsp; For the last attainment of the loftiest and 
truest genius is precisely this&mdash;to gain such insight of the
real that all else becomes subsidiary.&nbsp; True simplicity and 
the abiding relief and enduring power of true art with all 
classes lies here and not elsewhere.&nbsp; Cleverness, 
refinement, fancy, and invention, even sublety of intellect, are 
practically nowhere in this sphere without this.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV&mdash;STEVENSON AS DRAMATIST</h2>
<p>In opposition to Mr Pinero, therefore, I assert that 
Stevenson&rsquo;s defect in spontaneous dramatic presentation is 
seen clearly in his novels as well as in his plays proper.</p>
<p>In writing to my good friend, Mr Thomas M&rsquo;Kie, Advocate,
Edinburgh, telling him of my work on R. L. Stevenson and the 
results, I thus gathered up in little the broad reflections on 
this point, and I may perhaps be excused quoting the following 
passages, as they reinforce by a new reference or illustration or
two what has just been said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Considering his great keenness and force on
some sides, I find R. L. Stevenson markedly deficient in grip on 
other sides&mdash;common sides, after all, of human nature.&nbsp;
This was so far largely due to a dreamy, mystical, so far 
perverted and, so to say, often even inverted casuistical, 
fatalistic morality, which would not allow him scope in what 
Carlyle would have called a healthy hatred of fools and 
scoundrels; with both of which classes&mdash;vagabonds in 
strictness&mdash;he had rather too much of a sneaking 
sympathy.&nbsp; Mr Pinero was wrong&mdash;totally and 
incomprehensibly wrong&mdash;when he told the good folks of 
Edinburgh at the Philosophical Institution, and afterwards at the
London Birkbeck Institution, that it was lack of concentration 
and care that made R. L. Stevenson a failure as a 
dramatist.&nbsp; No: it was here and not elsewhere that the 
failure lay.&nbsp; R. L. Stevenson was himself an unconscious 
paradox&mdash;and sometimes he realised it&mdash;his great 
weakness from this point of view being that he wished to show 
strong and original by making the villain the hero of the piece 
as well.&nbsp; Now, <i>that</i>, if it may, by clever 
manipulation and dexterity, be made to do in a novel, most 
certainly it will not do on the stage&mdash;more especially if it
is done consciously and, as it were, of <i>malice prepense</i>; 
because, for one thing, there is in the theatre a very varied yet
united audience which has to give a simultaneous and immediate 
verdict&mdash;an audience not inclined to some kinds of 
overwrought subtleties and casuistries, however clever the 
technique.&nbsp; If <i>The Master of Ballantrae</i> (which has 
some highly dramatic scenes and situations, if it is not in 
itself substantially a drama) were to be put on the stage, the 
playwright, if wisely determined for success, would really 
have&mdash;not in details, but in essential conception&mdash;to 
kick R. L. Stevenson in his most personal aim out of it, and take
and present a more definite moral view of the two villain-heroes 
(brothers, too); improve and elevate the one a bit if he lowered 
the other, and not wobble in sympathy and try to make the 
audience wobble in sympathy also, as R. L. Stevenson certainly 
does.&nbsp; As for <i>Beau Austin</i>, it most emphatically, in 
view of this, should be re-writ&mdash;re-writ especially towards 
the ending&mdash;and the scandalous Beau tarred and feathered, 
metaphorically speaking, instead of walking off at the end in a 
sneaking, mincing sort of way, with no more than a little 
momentary twinge of discomfort at the wreck and ruin he has 
wrought, for having acted as a selfish, snivelling poltroon and 
coward, though in fine clothes and with fine ways and fine 
manners, which only, from our point of view, make matters 
worse.&nbsp; It is, with variations I admit, much the same all 
through: R. L. Stevenson felt it and confessed it about the 
<i>Ebb-Tide</i>, and Huish, the cockney hero and villain; but the
sense of healthy disgust, even at the vile Huish, is not 
emphasised in the book as it would have demanded to be for the 
stage&mdash;the audience would not have stood it, and the more 
mixed and varied, the less would it have stood it&mdash;not at 
all; and his relief of style and fine or finished speeches would 
not <i>there</i> in the least have told.&nbsp; This is demanded 
of the drama&mdash;that at once it satisfies a certain crude 
something subsisting under all outward glosses and veneers that 
might be in some a lively sense of right and wrong&mdash;the 
uprisal of a conscience, in fact, or in others a vague instinct 
of proper reward or punishment, which will even cover and 
sanction certain kinds of revenge or retaliation.&nbsp; The one 
feeling will emerge most among the cultured, and the other among 
the ruder and more ignorant; but both meet immediately on 
beholding action and the limits of action on the demand for some 
clear leading to what may be called Providential 
equity&mdash;each man undoubtedly rewarded or punished, roughly, 
according to his deserts, if not outwardly then certainly in the 
inner torments that so often lead to confessions.&nbsp; There it 
is&mdash;a radical fact of human nature&mdash;as radical as any 
reading of trait or determination of character 
presented&mdash;seen in the Greek drama as well as in Shakespeare
and the great Elizabethan dramatists, and in the 
drama-transpontine and others of to-day.&nbsp; R. L. Stevenson 
was all too casuistical (though not in the exclusively bad sense)
for this; and so he was not dramatic, though <i>Weir of 
Hermiston</i> promised something like an advance to it, and <i>St
Ives</i> did, in my idea, yet more.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The one essential of a <i>dramatic</i> piece is that, by the 
interaction of character and incident (one or other may be 
preponderating, according to the type and intention of the 
writer) all naturally leads up to a crisis in which the moral 
motives, appealed to or awakened by the presentation of the play,
are justified.&nbsp; Where this is wanting the true leading and 
the definite justification are wanting.&nbsp; Goethe failed in 
this in his <i>Faust</i>, resourceful and far-seeing though he 
was&mdash;he failed because a certain sympathy is awakened for 
Mephistopheles in being, so to say, chivied out of his bargain, 
when he had complied with the terms of the contract by Faust; and
Gounod in his opera does exactly for &ldquo;immediate dramatic 
effect,&rdquo; what we hold it would be necessary to do for R. L.
Stevenson.&nbsp; Goethe, with his casuistries which led him to 
allegory and all manner of overdone symbolisms and perversions in
the Second Part, is set aside and a true crisis and close is 
found by Gounod through simply sending Marguerite above and Faust
below, as, indeed, Faust had agreed by solemn compact with 
Mephistopheles that it should be.&nbsp; And to come to another 
illustration from our own times, Mr Bernard Shaw&rsquo;s very 
clever and all too ingenious and over-subtle <i>Man and 
Superman</i> would, in my idea, and for much the same reason, be 
an utterly ineffective and weak piece on the stage, however 
carefully handled and however clever the setting&mdash;the reason
lying in the egotistic upsetting of the &ldquo;personal 
equation&rdquo; and the theory of life that lies behind 
all&mdash;tinting it with strange and even <i>outr&eacute;</i> 
colours.&nbsp; Much the same has to be said of most of what are 
problem-plays&mdash;several of Ibsen&rsquo;s among the rest.</p>
<p>Those who remember the Fairy opera of <i>Hansel and Gretel</i>
on the stage in London, will not have forgotten in the witching 
memory of all the charms of scenery and setting, how the scene 
where the witch of the wood, who was planning out the baking of 
the little hero and heroine in her oven, having 
&ldquo;fatted&rdquo; them up well, to make sweet her eating of 
them, was by the coolness and cleverness of the heroine locked in
her own oven and baked there, literally brought down the 
house.&nbsp; She received exactly what she had planned to give 
those children, whom their own cruel parents had unwittingly, by 
losing the children in the wood, put into her hands.&nbsp; 
Quaint, na&iuml;ve, half-grotesque it was in conception, yet the 
truth of all drama was there actively exhibited, and all 
casuistic pleading of excuses of some sort, even of justification
for the witch (that it was her nature; heredity in her aworking, 
etc., etc.) would have not only been out of place, but hotly 
resented by that audience.&nbsp; Now, Stevenson, if he could have
made up his mind to have the witch locked in her own oven, would 
most assuredly have tried some device to get her out by some 
fairy witch-device or magic slide at the far end of it, and have 
proceeded to paint for us the changed character that she was 
after she had been so outwitted by a child, and her witchdom 
proved after all of little effect.&nbsp; He would have put 
probably some of the most effective moralities into her mouth if 
indeed he would not after all have made the witch a triumph on 
his early principle of bad-heartedness being strength.&nbsp; If 
this is the sort of falsification which the play demands, and is 
of all tastes the most ungrateful, then, it is clear, that for 
full effect of the drama it is essential to it; but what is 
primary in it is the direct answering to certain immediate and 
instinctive demands in common human nature, the doing of which is
far more effective than no end of deep philosophy to show how 
much better human nature would be if it were not just quite thus 
constituted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Concentration,&rdquo; says Mr Pinero, 
&ldquo;is first, second, and last in it,&rdquo; and he goes on 
thus, as reported in the <i>Scotsman</i>, to show 
Stevenson&rsquo;s defect and mistake and, as is not, of course, 
unnatural, to magnify the greatness and grandeur of the style of 
work in which he has himself been so successful.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;If Stevenson had ever mastered that 
art&mdash;and I do not question that if he had properly conceived
it he had it in him to master it&mdash;he might have found the 
stage a gold mine, but he would have found, too, that it is a 
gold mine which cannot be worked in a smiling, sportive, 
half-contemptuous spirit, but only in the sweat of the brain, and
with every mental nerve and sinew strained to its 
uttermost.&nbsp; He would have known that no ingots are to be got
out of this mine, save after sleepless nights, days of gloom and 
discouragement, and other days, again, of feverish toil, the 
result of which proves in the end to be misapplied and has to be 
thrown to the winds. . . . When you take up a play-book (if ever 
you do take one up) it strikes you as being a very trifling 
thing&mdash;a mere insubstantial pamphlet beside the imposing 
bulk of the latest six-shilling novel.&nbsp; Little do you guess 
that every page of the play has cost more care, severer mental 
tension, if not more actual manual labour, than any chapter of a 
novel, though it be fifty pages long.&nbsp; It is the height of 
the author&rsquo;s art, according to the old maxim, that the 
ordinary spectator should never be clearly conscious of the skill
and travail that have gone to the making of the finished 
product.&nbsp; But the artist who would achieve a like feat must 
realise its difficulties, or what are his chances of 
success?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what I should, in little, be inclined to say, in answer to
the &ldquo;concentration&rdquo; idea is that, unless you have 
first some firm hold on the broad bed-rock facts of human nature 
specially appealed to or called forth by the drama, you may 
concentrate as much as you please, but you will not write a 
successful acting drama, not to speak of a great one.&nbsp; Mr 
Pinero&rsquo;s magnifications of the immense effort demanded from
him must in the end come to mean that he himself does not 
instinctively and with natural ease and spontaneity secure this, 
but secures it only after great conscious effort; and hence, 
perhaps, it is that he as well as so many other modern 
playwrights fall so far behind alike in the amount turned out, 
and also in its quality as compared with the products of many 
playwrights in the past.</p>
<p>The problem drama, in every phase and turn of it, endeavours 
to dispense with these fundamental demands implied in the common 
and instinctive sense or consciousness of the mass of men and 
women, and to substitute for that interest something which will 
artificially supersede it, or, at any rate, take its place.&nbsp;
The interest is transferred from the crises necessarily worked up
to in the one case, with all of situation and dialogue directed 
to it, and without which it would not be strictly explicable, to 
something abnormal, odd, artificial or inverted, or exceptional 
in the characters themselves.&nbsp; Having thus, instead of 
natural process and sequence, if we may put it so, the problem 
dramatist has a double task&mdash;he must gain what unity he can,
and reach such crises as he may by artificial aids and inventions
which the more he uses the more makes natural simplicity 
unattainable; and next he must reduce and hide as far as he can 
the abnormality he has, after all, in the long run, created and 
presented.&nbsp; He cannot maintain it to the full, else his work
would become a mere medical or psychological treatise under the 
poorest of disguises; and the very necessity for the action and 
reaction of characters upon each other is a further element 
against him.&nbsp; In a word no one character can stand alone, 
and cannot escape influencing others, and also the action.&nbsp; 
Thus it is that he cannot isolate as a doctor does his patient 
for scientific examination.&nbsp; The healthy and normal must 
come in to modify on all sides what is presented of unhealthy and
abnormal, and by its very presence expose the other, while at the
same time it, by its very presence, ministers improvement, 
exactly as the sunlight disperses mist and all unhealthy vapours,
germs, and microbes.</p>
<p>The problem dramatist, in place of broad effect and truth to 
nature, must find it in stress of invention and resource of that 
kind.&nbsp; Thus care and concentration must be all in all with 
him&mdash;he must never let himself go, or get so interested and 
taken with his characters that <i>they</i>, in a sense, control 
or direct him.&nbsp; He is all too conscious a 
&ldquo;maker&rdquo; and must pay for his originality by what in 
the end is really painful and overweighted work.&nbsp; This, I 
take it, is the reason why so many of the modern dramatists find 
their work so hard, and are, comparatively, so slow in the 
production of it, while they would fain, by many devices, secure 
the general impression or appeal made to all classes alike by the
natural or what we may call spontaneous drama, they are yet, by 
the necessity of subject matter and methods of dealing with it, 
limited to the real interest of a special class&mdash;to whom is 
finally given up what was meant for mankind&mdash;and the 
troublesome and trying task laid on them, to try as best they may
to reconcile two really conflicting tendencies which cannot even 
by art be reconciled but really point different ways and tend to 
different ends.&nbsp; As the impressionist and the 
pre-Raphaelite, in the sister-art of painting cannot be combined 
and reconciled in one painter&mdash;so it is here; by conception 
and methods they go different ways, and if they <i>seek</i> the 
same end, it is by opposing processes&mdash;the original 
conception alike of nature and of art dictating the process.</p>
<p>As for Stevenson, it was no lack of care or concentration in 
anything that he touched; these two were never lacking, but 
because his subtlety, mystical bias and dreaminess, and 
theorising on human nature made this to him impossible.&nbsp; He 
might have concentrated as much as he pleased, concentrated as 
much as even Mr Pinero desires, but he would not have made a 
successful drama, because he was Robert Louis Stevenson, and not 
Mr Pinero, and too long, as he himself confessed, had a tendency 
to think bad-heartedness was strength; while the only true and 
enduring joy attainable in this world&mdash;whether by deduction 
from life itself, or from <i>impressions</i> of art or of the 
drama, is simply the steady, unassailable, and triumphant 
consciousness that it is not so, but the reverse, that goodness 
and self-sacrifice and self-surrender are the only strength in 
the universe.&nbsp; Just as Byron had it with 
patriotism:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Freedom&rsquo;s battle once begun,<br />
Bequeathed from bleeding sire to son,<br />
Tho&rsquo; baffled oft is ever won.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To go consciously either in fiction or in the drama for 
bad-heartedness as strength, is to court failure&mdash;the broad,
healthy, human heart, thank Heaven, is so made as to resent the 
doctrine; and if a fiction or a play based on this idea for the 
moment succeeds, it can only be because of strength in other 
elements, or because of partial blindness and partially paralysed
moral sense in the case of those who accept it and joy in 
it.&nbsp; If Mr Pinero directly disputes this, then he and I have
no common standing-ground, and I need not follow the matter any 
further.&nbsp; Of course, the dramatist may, under mistaken 
sympathy and in the midst of complex and bewildering 
concatenations, give wrong readings to his audience, but he must 
not be always doing even that, or doing it on principle or 
system, else his work, however careful and concentrated, will 
before long share the fate of the Stevenson-Henley dramas 
confessedly wrought when the authors all too definitely held 
bad-heartedness was strength.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV&mdash;THEORY OF GOOD AND EVIL</h2>
<p>We have not hitherto concerned ourselves, in any express 
sense, with the ethical elements involved in the tendency now 
dwelt on, though they are, of necessity, of a very vital 
character.&nbsp; We have shown only as yet the effect of this 
mood of mind on dramatic intention and effort.&nbsp; The position
is simply that there is, broadly speaking, the endeavour to 
eliminate an element which is essential to successful dramatic 
presentation.&nbsp; That element is the eternal distinction, 
speaking broadly, between good and evil&mdash;between right and 
wrong&mdash;between the secret consciousness of having done 
right, and the consciousness of mere strength and force in 
certain other ways.</p>
<p>Nothing else will make up for vagueness and cloudiness 
here&mdash;no technical skill, no apt dialogue nor concentration,
any more than &ldquo;fine speeches,&rdquo; as Mr Pinero calls 
them.&nbsp; Now the dramatic demand and the ethical demand here 
meet and take each other&rsquo;s hands, and will not be 
separated.&nbsp; This is why Mr Stevenson and Mr 
Henley&mdash;young men of great talent, failed&mdash;utterly 
failed&mdash;they thought they could make a hero out of a shady 
and dare-devil yet really cowardly villain generally&mdash;and 
failed.</p>
<p>The spirit of this is of the clever youth type&mdash;all too 
ready to forego the moral for the sake of the fun any day of the 
week, and the unthinking selfishness and self-enjoyment of 
youth&mdash;whose tender mercies are often cruel, are 
transcendent in it.&nbsp; As Stevenson himself said, they were 
young men then and fancied bad-heartedness was strength.&nbsp; 
Perhaps it was a sense of this that made R. L. Stevenson speak as
he did of the <i>Ebb-Tide</i> with Huish the cockney in it, after
he was powerless to recall it; which made him say, as we have 
seen, that the closing chapters of <i>The Master of 
Ballantrae</i> &ldquo;<i>shame</i>, <i>and perhaps degrade</i>, 
<i>the beginning</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He himself came to see then 
the great error; but, alas! it was too late to remedy it&mdash;he
could but go forward to essay new tales, not backward to put 
right errors in what was done.</p>
<p>Did Mr William Archer have anything of this in his mind and 
the far-reaching effects on this side, when he wrote the 
following:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Let me add that the omission with which, in
1885, I mildly reproached him&mdash;the omission to tell what he 
knew to be an essential part of the truth about life&mdash;was 
abundantly made good in his later writings.&nbsp; It is true that
even in his final philosophy he still seems to me to underrate, 
or rather to shirk, the significance of that most compendious 
parable which he thus relates in a letter to Mr Henry 
James:&mdash;&lsquo;Do you know the story of the man who found a 
button in his hash, and called the waiter?&nbsp; &ldquo;What do 
you call that?&rdquo; says he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the
waiter, &ldquo;what d&rsquo;you expect?&nbsp; Expect to find a 
gold watch and chain?&rdquo;&nbsp; Heavenly apologue, is it 
not?&rsquo;&nbsp; Heavenly, by all means; but I think Stevenson 
relished the humour of it so much that he &lsquo;smiling passed 
the moral by.&rsquo;&nbsp; In his enjoyment of the waiter&rsquo;s
effrontery, he forgot to sympathise with the man (even though it 
was himself) who had broken his teeth upon the harmful, 
unnecessary button.&nbsp; He forgot that all the apologetics in 
the world are based upon just this audacious 
paralogism.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many writers have done the same&mdash;and not a few critics 
have hinted at this: I do not think any writer has got at the 
radical truth of it more directly, decisively, and clearly than 
&ldquo;J. F. M.,&rdquo; in a monthly magazine, about the time of 
Stevenson&rsquo;s death; and the whole is so good and clear that 
I must quote it&mdash;the writer was not thinking of the drama 
specially; only of prose fiction, and this but makes the passage 
the more effective and apt to my point.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;In the outburst of regret which followed 
the death of Robert Louis Stevenson, one leading journal dwelt on
his too early removal in middle life &lsquo;with only half his 
message delivered.&rsquo;&nbsp; Such a phrase may have been used 
in the mere cant of modern journalism.&nbsp; Still it set one 
questioning what was Stevenson&rsquo;s message, or at least that 
part of it which we had time given us to hear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wonderful as was the popularity of the dead author, we 
are inclined to doubt whether the right appreciation of him was 
half as wide.&nbsp; To a certain section of the public he seemed 
a successful writer of boys&rsquo; books, which yet held captive 
older people.&nbsp; Now, undoubtedly there was an element (not 
the highest) in his work which fascinated boys.&nbsp; It 
gratified their yearning for adventure.&nbsp; To too large a 
number of his readers, we suspect, this remains Stevenson&rsquo;s
chief charm; though even of those there were many able to 
recognise and be thankful for the literary power and grace which 
could serve up their sanguinary diet so daintily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most of Stevenson&rsquo;s titles, too, like <i>Treasure
Island</i>, <i>Kidnapped</i>, and<i> The Master of 
Ballantrae</i>, tended to foster delusion in this 
direction.&nbsp; The books were largely bought for gifts by 
maiden aunts, and bestowed as school prizes, when it might not 
have been so had their titles given more indication of their real
scope and tendency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this, it seems to us, has somewhat obscured 
Stevenson&rsquo;s true power, which is surely that of an 
arch-delineator of &lsquo;human nature&rsquo; and of the devious 
ways of men.&nbsp; As we read him we feel that we have our finger
on the pulse of the cruel politics of the world.&nbsp; He has the
Shakespearean gift which makes us recognise that his pirates and 
his statesmen, with their violence and their murders and their 
perversions of justice, are swayed by the same interests and are 
pulling the same strings and playing on the same passions which 
are at work in quieter methods around ourselves.&nbsp; The vast 
crimes and the reckless bloodshed are nothing more nor less than 
stage effects used to accentuate for the common eye what the seer
can detect without them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And reading him from this standpoint, Stevenson&rsquo;s
&lsquo;message&rsquo; (so far as it was delivered) appears to be 
that of utter gloom&mdash;the creed that good is always overcome 
by evil.&nbsp; We do not mean in the sense that good always 
suffers through evil and is frequently crucified by evil.&nbsp; 
That is only the sowing of the martyr&rsquo;s blood, which is, we
know, the seed of the Church.&nbsp; We should not have marvelled 
in the least that a genius like Stevenson should rebel against 
mere external &lsquo;happy endings,&rsquo; which, being in flat 
contradiction to the ordinary ways of Providence, are little 
short of thoughtless blasphemy against Providence.&nbsp; But the 
terrible thing about the Stevenson philosophy of life is that it 
seems to make evil overcome good in the sense of absorbing it, or
perverting it, or at best lowering it.&nbsp; When good and evil 
come in conflict in one person, Dr Jekyll vanishes into Mr 
Hyde.&nbsp; The awful Master of Ballantrae drags down his 
brother, though he seems to fight for his soul at every 
step.&nbsp; The sequel to <i>Kidnapped</i> shows David Balfour 
ready at last to be hail-fellow-well-met with the supple 
Prestongrange and the other intriguers, even though they had 
forcibly made him a partner to their shedding of innocent 
blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that this was what Stevenson&rsquo;s 
experience of real life had brought him?&nbsp; Fortunate himself 
in so many respects, he was yet one of those who turn aside from 
the smooth and sunny paths of life, to enter into brotherly 
sympathy and fellowship with the disinherited.&nbsp; Is this, 
then, what he found on those darker levels?&nbsp; Did he discover
that triumphant hypocrisy treads down souls as well as lives?</p>
<p>&ldquo;We cannot doubt that it often does so; and it is well 
that we should see this sometimes, to make us strong to contend 
with evil before it works out this, its worst mischief, and to 
rouse us from the easy optimist laziness which sits idle while 
others are being wronged, and bids them believe &lsquo;that all 
will come right in the end,&rsquo; when it is our direct duty to 
do our utmost to make it &lsquo;come right&rsquo; to-day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But to show us nothing but the gloomy side, nothing but
the weakness of good, nothing but the strength of evil, does not 
inspire us to contend for the right, does not inform us of the 
powers and weapons with which we might so contend.&nbsp; To gaze 
at unqualified and inevitable moral defeat will but leave us to 
the still worse laziness of pessimism, uttering its discouraging 
and blasphemous cry, &lsquo;It does not matter; nothing will ever
come right!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shakespeare has shown us&mdash;and never so nobly as in
his last great creation of <i>The Tempest</i>&mdash;that a man 
has one stronghold which none but himself can deliver over to the
enemy&mdash;that citadel of his own conduct and character, from 
which he can smile supreme upon the foe, who may have conquered 
all down the line, but must finally make pause there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must remember that <i>The Tempest</i> was 
Shakespeare&rsquo;s last work.&nbsp; The genuine consciousness of
the possible triumph of the moral nature against every assault is
probably reserved for the later years of life, when, somewhat 
withdrawn from the passions of its struggle, we become those 
lookers-on who see most of the game.&nbsp; Strange fate is it 
that so much of our genius vanishes into the great silence before
those later years are reached!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stevenson was too late in awakening fully to the tragic error 
to which short-sighted youth is apt to wander that 
&ldquo;bad-heartedness is strength.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so, from 
this point of view, to our sorrow, he too much verified 
Goethe&rsquo;s saw that &ldquo;simplicity (not artifice) and 
repose are the acme of art, and therefore no youth can be a 
master.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, he might very well from another 
side, have taken one of Goethe&rsquo;s fine sayings as a motto 
for himself:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Greatest saints were ever most 
kindly-hearted to sinners;<br />
Here I&rsquo;m a saint with the best; sinners I never could 
hate.&rdquo; <a name="citation7"></a><a href="#footnote7" 
class="citation">[7]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stevenson&rsquo;s own verdict on <i>Deacon Brodie</i> given to
a <i>New York Herald</i> reporter on the author&rsquo;s arrival 
in New York in September 1887, on the <i>Ludgate Hill</i>, is 
thus very near the precise truth: &ldquo;The piece has been all 
overhauled, and though I have no idea whether it will please an 
audience, I don&rsquo;t think either Mr Henley or I are ashamed 
of it.&nbsp; <i>But we were both young men when we did that</i>, 
<i>and I think we had an idea that bad-heartedness was 
strength</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Mr Henley in any way confirmed R. L. Stevenson in this 
perversion, as I much fear he did, no true admirer of Stevenson 
has much to thank him for, whatever claims he may have fancied he
had to Stevenson&rsquo;s eternal gratitude.&nbsp; He did 
Stevenson about the very worst turn he could have done, and aided
and abetted in robbing us and the world of yet greater works than
we have had from his hands.&nbsp; He was but condemning himself 
when he wrote some of the detractory things he did in the <i>Pall
Mall Magazine</i> about the <i>Edinburgh Edition</i>, etc.&nbsp; 
Men are mirrors in which they see each other: Henley, after all, 
painted himself much more effectively in that now notorious 
<i>Pall Mall Magazine</i> article than he did R. L. 
Stevenson.&nbsp; Such is the penalty men too often pay for 
wreaking paltry revenges&mdash;writing under morbid memories and 
narrow and petty grievances&mdash;they not only fail in truth and
impartiality, but inscribe a kind of grotesque parody of 
themselves in their effort to make their subject ridiculous, as 
he did, for example, about the name Lewis=Louis, and various 
other things.</p>
<p>R. L. Stevenson&rsquo;s fate was to be a casuistic and mystic 
moralist at bottom, and could not help it; while, owing to some 
kink or twist, due, perhaps, mainly to his earlier sufferings, 
and the teachings he then received, he could not help giving it 
always a turn to what he himself called 
&ldquo;tail-foremost&rdquo; or inverted morality; and it was not 
till near the close that he fully awakened to the fact that here 
he was false to the truest canons at once of morality and life 
and art, and that if he pursued this course his doom was, and 
would be, to make his endings &ldquo;disgrace, or perhaps, 
degrade his beginnings,&rdquo; and that no true and effective 
dramatic unity and effect and climax was to be gained.&nbsp; Pity
that he did so much on this perverted view of life and world and 
art: and well it is that he came to perceive it, even though 
almost too late:&mdash;certainly too late for that full 
presentment of that awful yet gladdening presence of a 
God&rsquo;s power and equity in this seeming tangled web of a 
world, the idea which inspired Robert Browning as well as 
Wordsworth, when he wrote, and gathered it up into a few lines in
<i>Pippa Passes</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The year&rsquo;s at the spring,<br />
And day&rsquo;s at the morn;<br />
Morning&rsquo;s at seven;<br />
The hillsides dew-pearled;</p>
<p>The lark&rsquo;s on the wing;<br />
The snail&rsquo;s on the thorn:<br />
God&rsquo;s in His heaven,<br />
All&rsquo;s right with the world.</p>
<p>. . . . . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;All service ranks the same with God,<br />
If now, as formerly he trod<br />
Paradise, His presence fills<br />
Our earth, each only as God wills<br />
Can work&mdash;God&rsquo;s puppets best and worst,<br />
Are we; there is no last or first.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It shows what he might have accomplished, had longer life been
but allowed him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI&mdash;STEVENSON&rsquo;S GLOOM</h2>
<p>The problem of Stevenson&rsquo;s gloom cannot be solved by any
commonplace cut-and-dried process.&nbsp; It will remain a problem
only unless (1) his original dreamy tendency crossed, if not 
warped, by the fatalistic Calvinism which was drummed into him by
father, mother, and nurse in his tender years, is taken fully 
into account; then (2) the peculiar action on such a nature of 
the unsatisfying and, on the whole, distracting effect of the 
bohemian and hail-fellow-well-met sort of ideal to which he 
yielded, and which has to be charged with much; and (3) the 
conflict in him of a keenly social animus with a very strong 
egotistical effusiveness, fed by fancy, and nourished by the 
enforced solitariness inevitable in the case of one who, from 
early years up, suffered from painful, and even crushing, 
disease.</p>
<p>His text and his sermon&mdash;which may be shortly summed in 
the following sentence&mdash;be kind, for in kindness to others 
lies the only true pleasure to be gained in life; be cheerful, 
even to the point of egotistic self-satisfaction, for through 
cheerfulness only is the flow of this incessant kindliness of 
thought and service possible.&nbsp; He was not in harmony with 
the actual effect of much of his creative work, though he 
illustrated this in his life, as few men have done.&nbsp; He 
regarded it as the highest duty of life to give pleasure to 
others; his art in his own idea thus became in an unostentatious 
way consecrated, and while he would not have claimed to be a 
seer, any more than he would have claimed to be a saint, as he 
would have held in contempt a mere sybarite, most certainly a 
vein of unblamable hedonism pervaded his whole philosophy of 
life.&nbsp; Suffering constantly, he still was always 
kindly.&nbsp; He encouraged, as Mr Gosse has said, this 
philosophy by every resource open to him.&nbsp; In practical 
life, all who knew him declared that he was brightness, 
na&iuml;ve fancy, and sunshine personified, and yet he could not 
help always, somehow, infusing into his fiction a pronounced, and
sometimes almost fatal, element of gloom.&nbsp; Even in his own 
case they were not pleasure-giving and failed thus in 
essence.&nbsp; Some wise critic has said that no man can ever 
write well creatively of that in which in his early youth he had 
no knowledge.&nbsp; Always behind Stevenson&rsquo;s latest 
exercises lies the shadow of this as an unshifting background, 
which by art may be relieved, but never refined away 
wholly.&nbsp; He cannot escape from it if he would.&nbsp; Here, 
too, as George MacDonald has neatly and nicely said: We are the 
victims of our own past, and often a hand is put forth upon us 
from behind and draws us into life backward.&nbsp; Here was 
Stevenson, with his half-hedonistic theories of life, the duty of
giving pleasure, of making eyes brighter, and casting sunshine 
around one wherever one went, yet the creator of gloom for us, 
when all the world was before him where to choose.&nbsp; This 
fateful shadow pursued him to the end, often giving us, as it 
were, the very justificative ground for his own father&rsquo;s 
despondency and gloom, which the son rather too decisively 
reproved, while he might have sympathised with it in a stranger, 
and in that most characteristic letter to his mother, which we 
have quoted, said that it made his father often seem, to him, to 
be ungrateful&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Has the man no 
gratitude</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Two selves thus persistently and 
constantly struggled in Stevenson.&nbsp; He was from this point 
of view, indeed, his own Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, the buoyant, 
self-enjoying, because pleasure-conferring, man, and at the same 
time the helpless yet fascinating &ldquo;dark interpreter&rdquo; 
of the gloomy and gloom-inspiring side of life, viewed from the 
point of view of dominating character and inherited 
influence.&nbsp; When he reached out his hand with desire of 
pleasure-conferring, lo and behold, as he wrote, a hand from his 
forefathers was stretched out, and he was pulled backward; so 
that, as he has confessed, his endings were apt to shame, perhaps
to degrade, the beginnings.&nbsp; Here is something pointing to 
the hidden and secret springs that feed the deeper will and bend 
it to their service.&nbsp; Individuality itself is but a mirror, 
which by its inequalities transforms things to odd shapes.&nbsp; 
Hawthorne confessed to something of this sort.&nbsp; He, like 
Stevenson, suffered much in youth, if not from disease then 
through accident, which kept him long from youthful 
company.&nbsp; At a time when he should have been running free 
with other boys, he had to be lonely, reading what books he could
lay his hands on, mostly mournful and puritanic, by the borders 
of lone Sebago Lake.&nbsp; He that hath once in youth been 
touched by this Marah-rod of bitterness will not easily escape 
from it, when he essays in later years to paint life and the 
world as he sees them; nay, the hand, when he deems himself 
freest, will be laid upon him from behind, if not to pull him, as
MacDonald has said, into life backward, then to make him a 
mournful witness of having once been touched by the Marah-rod, 
whose bitterness again declares itself and wells out its 
bitterness when set even in the rising and the stirring of the 
waters.</p>
<p>Such is our view of the &ldquo;gloom&rdquo; of 
Stevenson&mdash;a gloom which well might have justified something
of his father&rsquo;s despondency.&nbsp; He struggles in vain to 
escape from it&mdash;it narrows, it fatefully hampers and limits 
the free field of his art, lays upon it a strange atmosphere, 
fascinating, but not favourable to true dramatic breadth and 
force, and spontaneous natural simplicity, invariably lending a 
certain touch of weakness, inconsistency, and inconclusiveness to
his endings; so that he himself could too often speak of them 
afterwards as apt to &ldquo;shame, perhaps to degrade, the 
beginnings.&rdquo;&nbsp; This is what true dramatic art should 
never do.&nbsp; In the ending all that may raise legitimate 
question in the process&mdash;all that is confusing, perplexing 
in the separate parts&mdash;is met, solved, reconciled, at least 
in a way satisfactory to the general, or ordinary mind; and thus 
such unity is by it so gained and sealed, that in no case can the
true artist, whatever faults may lie in portions of the 
process-work, say of his endings that &ldquo;they shame, perhaps 
degrade, the beginning.&rdquo;&nbsp; Wherever this is the case 
there will be &ldquo;gloom,&rdquo; and there will also be a sad, 
tormenting sense of something wanting.&nbsp; &ldquo;The evening 
brings a &lsquo;hame&rsquo;;&rdquo; so should it be 
here&mdash;should it especially be in a dramatic work.&nbsp; If 
not, &ldquo;We start; for soul is wanting there;&rdquo; or, if 
not soul, then the last halo of the soul&rsquo;s serene 
triumph.&nbsp; From this side, too, there is another cause for 
the undramatic character, in the stricter sense of 
Stevenson&rsquo;s work generally: it is, after all, distressful, 
unsatisfying, egotistic, for fancy is led at the beck of some 
pre-established disharmony which throws back an abiding and 
irremovable gloom on all that went before; and the free 
spontaneous grace of natural creation which ensures natural 
simplicity is, as said already, not quite attained.</p>
<p>It was well pointed out in <i>Hammerton</i>, by an unanonymous
author there quoted (pp. 22, 23), that while in the story, Hyde, 
the worse one, wins, in Stevenson himself&mdash;in his real 
life&mdash;Jekyll won, and not Mr Hyde.&nbsp; This writer, too, 
might have added that the Master of Ballantrae also wins as well 
as Beau Austin and Deacon Brodie.&nbsp; R. L. Stevenson&rsquo;s 
dramatic art and a good deal of his fiction, then, was untrue to 
his life, and on one side was a lie&mdash;it was not in 
consonance with his own practice or his belief as expressed in 
life.</p>
<p>In some other matters the test laid down here is not difficult
of application.&nbsp; Stevenson, at the time he wrote <i>The 
Foreigner at Home</i>, had seen a good deal; he had been abroad; 
he had already had experiences; he had had differences with his 
father about Calvinism and some other things; and yet just see 
how he applies the standard of his earlier knowledge and 
observation to England&mdash;and by doing so, cannot help 
exaggerating the outstanding differences, always with an almost 
provincial accent of unwavering conviction due to his early 
associations and knowledge.&nbsp; He cannot help paying an 
excessive tribute to the Calvinism he had formally rejected, in 
so far as, according to him, it goes to form character&mdash;even
national character, at all events, in its production of types; 
and he never in any really effective way glances at what Mr 
Matthew Arnold called &ldquo;Scottish manners, Scottish 
drink&rdquo; as elements in any way radically qualifying.&nbsp; 
It is not, of course, that I, as a Scotsman, well acquainted with
rural life in some parts of England, as with rural life in many 
parts of Scotland in my youth, do not heartily agree with 
him&mdash;the point is that, when he comes to this sort of 
comparison and contrast, he writes exactly as his father would or
might have done, with a full consciousness, after all, of the 
tribute he was paying to the practical outcome on character of 
the Calvinism in which he so thoroughly believed.&nbsp; It is, in
its way, a very peculiar thing&mdash;and had I space, and did I 
believe it would prove interesting to readers in general, I might
write an essay on it, with instances&mdash;in which case the 
Address to the Scottish Clergy would come in for more notice, 
citation and application than it has yet received.&nbsp; But 
meanwhile just take this little snippet&mdash;very characteristic
and very suggestive in its own way&mdash;and tell me whether it 
does not justify and bear out fully what I have now said as 
illustrating a certain side and a strange uncertain limitation in
Stevenson:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;But it is not alone in scenery and 
architecture that we count England foreign.&nbsp; The 
constitution of society, the very pillars of the empire, surprise
and even pain us.&nbsp; The dull neglected peasant, sunk in 
matter, insolent, gross and servile, makes a startling contrast 
to our own long-legged, long-headed, thoughtful, Bible-loving 
ploughman.&nbsp; A week or two in such a place as Suffolk leaves 
the Scotsman gasping.&nbsp; It seems impossible that within the 
boundaries of his own island a class should have been thus 
forgotten.&nbsp; Even the educated and intelligent who hold our 
own opinions and speak in our own words, yet seem to hold them 
with a difference or from another reason, and to speak on all 
things with less interest and conviction.&nbsp; The first shock 
of English society is like a cold plunge.&rdquo; <a 
name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8" 
class="citation">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As there was a great deal of the &ldquo;John Bull 
element&rdquo; <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9" 
class="citation">[9]</a> in the little dreamer De Quincey, so 
there was a great deal, after all, of the rather conceited 
Calvinistic Scot in R. L. Stevenson, and it is to be traced as 
clearly in certain of his fictions as anywhere, though he himself
would not perhaps have seen it and acknowledged it, as I am here 
forced now to see it, and to acknowledge it for him.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII&mdash;PROOFS OF GROWTH</h2>
<p>Once again I quote Goethe:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Natural simplicity and repose are the acme 
of art, and hence it follows no youth can be a master.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has to be confessed that seldom, if ever, does Stevenson 
naturally and by sheer enthusiasm for subject and characters 
attain this natural simplicity, if he often attained the 
counterfeit presentment&mdash;artistic and graceful euphony, and 
new, subtle, and often unexpected concatenations of phrase.&nbsp;
Style is much; but it is not everything.&nbsp; We often love 
Scott the more that he shows loosenesses and lapses here, for, in
spite of them, he gains natural simplicity, while not seldom 
Stevenson, with all his art and fine sense of verbal music, 
rather misses it.&nbsp; <i>The Sedulous Ape</i> sometimes 
disenchants as well as charms; for occasionally a word, a touch, 
a turn, sends us off too directly in search of the model; and 
this operates against the interest as introducing a new and alien
series of associations, where, for full effect, it should not be 
so.&nbsp; And this distraction will be the more insistent, the 
more knowledge the reader has and the more he remembers; and 
since Stevenson&rsquo;s first appeal, both by his spirit and his 
methods, is to the cultured and well read, rather than to the 
great mass, his &ldquo;sedulous apehood&rdquo; only the more 
directly wars against him as regards deep, continuous, and 
lasting impression; where he should be most simple, natural and 
spontaneous; he also is most artificial and involved.&nbsp; If 
the story-writer is not so much in earnest, not so possessed by 
his matter that this is allowed to him, how is it to be hoped 
that we shall be possessed in the reading of it?&nbsp; More than 
once in <i>Catriona</i> we must own we had this experience, 
directly warring against full possession by the story, and 
certain passages about Simon Lovat were especially marked by 
this; if even the first introduction to Catriona herself was not 
so.&nbsp; As for Miss Barbara Grant, of whom so much has been 
made by many admirers, she is decidedly clever, indeed too clever
by half, and yet her doom is to be a mere <i>deus ex 
machin&acirc;</i>, and never do more than just pay a little 
tribute to Stevenson&rsquo;s own power of <i>persiflage</i>, or, 
if you like, to pay a penalty, poor lass, for the too perfect 
doing of hat, and really, really, I could not help saying this 
much, though, I do believe that she deserved just a wee bit 
better fate than that.</p>
<p>But we have proofs of great growth, and nowhere are they 
greater than at the very close.&nbsp; Stevenson died young: in 
some phases he was but a youth to the last.&nbsp; To a true 
critic then, the problem is, having already attained so 
much&mdash;a grand style, grasp of a limited group of characters,
with fancy, sincerity, and imagination,&mdash;what would 
Stevenson have attained in another ten years had such been but 
allotted him?&nbsp; It has over and over again been said that, 
for long he <i>shied</i> presenting women altogether.&nbsp; This 
is not quite true: <i>Thrawn Janet</i> was an earlier effort; and
if there the problem is persistent, the woman is real.&nbsp; Here
also he was on the right road&mdash;the advance road.&nbsp; The 
sex-question was coming forward as inevitably a part of life, and
could not be left out in any broad and true picture.&nbsp; This 
element was effectively revived in <i>Weir of Hermiston</i>, and 
&ldquo;Weir&rdquo; has been well said to be sadder, if it does 
not go deeper than <i>Denis Duval</i> or <i>Edwin 
Drood</i>.&nbsp; We know what Dickens and Thackeray could do 
there; we can but guess now what Stevenson would have done.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Weir&rdquo; is but a fragment; but, to a wisely critical 
and unprejudiced mind, it suffices to show not only what the 
complete work would have been, but what would have inevitably 
followed it.&nbsp; It shows the turning-point, and the way that 
was to be followed at the cross-roads&mdash;the way into a 
bigger, realer, grander world, where realism, freed from the 
dream, and fancy, and prejudice of youth, would glory in 
achieving the more enduring romance of manhood, maturity and 
humanity.</p>
<p>Yes; there was growth&mdash;undoubted growth.&nbsp; The 
questioning and severely moral element mainly due to the Shorter 
Catechism&mdash;the tendency to casuistry, and to problems, and 
wistful introspection&mdash;which had so coloured 
Stevenson&rsquo;s art up to the date of <i>The Master of 
Ballantrae</i>, and made him a great essayist, was passing in the
satisfaction of assured insight into life itself.&nbsp; The art 
would gradually have been transformed also.&nbsp; The problem, 
pure and simple, would have been subdued in face of the great 
facts of life; if not lost, swallowed up in the grandeur, pathos,
and awe of the tragedy clearly realised and presented.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVIII&mdash;EARLIER DETERMINATIONS AND RESULTS</h2>
<p>Stevenson&rsquo;s earlier determination was so distinctly to 
the symbolic, the parabolic, allegoric, dreamy and 
mystical&mdash;to treatment of the world as an array of weird or 
half-fanciful existences, witnessing only to certain dim 
spiritual facts or abstract moralities, occasionally inverted 
moralities&mdash;&ldquo;tail foremost moralities&rdquo; as later 
he himself named them&mdash;that a strong Celtic strain in him 
had been detected and dwelt on by acute critics long before any 
attention had been given to his genealogy on both sides of the 
house.&nbsp; The strong Celtic strain is now amply attested by 
many researches.&nbsp; Such phantasies as <i>The House of 
Eld</i>, <i>The Touchstone</i>, <i>The Poor Thing</i>, and <i>The
Song of the Morrow</i>, published along with some fables at the 
end of an edition of <i>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i>, by 
Longman&rsquo;s, I think, in 1896, tell to the initiated as 
forcibly as anything could tell of the presence of this element, 
as though moonshine, disguising and transfiguring, was laid over 
all real things and the secret of the world and life was in its 
glamour: the shimmering and soft shading rendering all outlines 
indeterminate, though a great idea is felt to be present in the 
mind of the author, for which he works.&nbsp; The man who would 
say there is no feeling for symbol&mdash;no phantasy or Celtic 
glamour in these weird, puzzling, and yet on all sides suggestive
tales would thereby be declared inept, inefficient&mdash;blind to
certain qualities that lie near to grandeur in fanciful 
literature, or the literature of phantasy, more properly.</p>
<p>This power in weird and playful phantasy is accompanied with 
the gift of impersonating or embodying mere abstract qualities or
tendencies in characters.&nbsp; The little early sketch written 
in June 1875, titled <i>Good Content</i>, well illustrates 
this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Pleasure goes by piping: Hope unfurls his 
purple flag; and meek Content follows them on a snow-white 
ass.&nbsp; Here, the broad sunlight falls on open ways and goodly
countries; here, stage by stage, pleasant old towns and hamlets 
border the road, now with high sign-poles, now with high minster 
spires; the lanes go burrowing under blossomed banks, green 
meadows, and deep woods encompass them about; from wood to wood 
flock the glad birds; the vane turns in the variable wind; and as
I journey with Hope and Pleasure, and quite a company of jolly 
personifications, who but the lady I love is by my side, and 
walks with her slim hand upon my arm?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suddenly, at a corner, something beckons; a phantom 
finger-post, a will o&rsquo; the wisp, a foolish challenge writ 
in big letters on a brand.&nbsp; And twisting his red moustaches,
braggadocio Virtue takes the perilous way where dim rain falls 
ever, and sad winds sigh.&nbsp; And after him, on his white ass, 
follows simpering Content.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever since I walk behind these two in the rain.&nbsp; 
Virtue is all a-cold; limp are his curling feather and fierce 
moustache.&nbsp; Sore besmirched, on his jackass, follows 
Content.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The record, entitled <i>Sunday Thoughts</i>, which is dated 
some five days earlier is na&iuml;ve and most characteristic, 
touched with the phantastic moralities and suggestions already 
indicated in every sentence; and rises to the fine climax in this
respect at the close.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;A plague o&rsquo; these Sundays!&nbsp; How 
the church bells ring up the sleeping past!&nbsp; I cannot go in 
to sermon: memories ache too hard; and so I hide out under the 
blue heavens, beside the small kirk whelmed in leaves.&nbsp; 
Tittering country girls see me as I go past from where they sit 
in the pews, and through the open door comes the loud psalm and 
the fervent solitary voice of the preacher.&nbsp; To and fro I 
wander among the graves, and now look over one side of the 
platform and see the sunlit meadow where the grown lambs go 
bleating and the ewes lie in the shadow under their heaped 
fleeces; and now over the other, where the rhododendrons flower 
fair among the chestnut boles, and far overhead the chestnut 
lifts its thick leaves and spiry blossom into the dark-blue 
air.&nbsp; Oh, the height and depth and thickness of the chestnut
foliage!&nbsp; Oh, to have wings like a dove, and dwell in the 
tree&rsquo;s green heart!</p>
<p>. . . . . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;A plague o&rsquo; these Sundays!&nbsp; How the Church 
bells ring up the sleeping past!&nbsp; Here has a maddening 
memory broken into my brain.&nbsp; To the door, to the door, with
the naked lunatic thought!&nbsp; Once it is forth we may talk of 
what we dare not entertain; once the intriguing thought has been 
put to the door I can watch it out of the loophole where, with 
its fellows, it raves and threatens in dumb show.&nbsp; Years ago
when that thought was young, it was dearer to me than all others,
and I would speak with it always when I had an hour alone.&nbsp; 
These rags that so dismally trick forth its madness were once the
splendid livery my favour wrought for it on my bed at 
night.&nbsp; Can you see the device on the badge?&nbsp; I dare 
not read it there myself, yet have a guess&mdash;&lsquo;<i>bad 
ware nicht</i>&rsquo;&mdash;is not that the humour of it?</p>
<p>. . . . . . . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;A plague o&rsquo; these Sundays!&nbsp; How the Church 
bells ring up the sleeping past!&nbsp; If I were a dove and dwelt
in the monstrous chestnuts, where the bees murmur all day about 
the flowers; if I were a sheep and lay on the field there under 
my comely fleece; if I were one of the quiet dead in the 
kirkyard&mdash;some homespun farmer dead for a long age, some 
dull hind who followed the plough and handled the sickle for 
threescore years and ten in the distant past; if I were anything 
but what I am out here, under the sultry noon, between the deep 
chestnuts, among the graves, where the fervent voice of the 
preacher comes to me, thin and solitary, through the open 
windows; <i>if I were what I was yesterday</i>, <i>and what</i>, 
<i>before God</i>, <i>I shall be again to-morrow</i>, <i>how 
should I outface these brazen memories</i>, <i>how live down this
unclean resurrection of dead hopes</i>!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Close associated with this always is the moralising faculty, 
which is assertive.&nbsp; Take here the cunning sentences on 
<i>Selfishness and Egotism</i>, very Hawthornian yet quite 
original:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;An unconscious, easy, selfish person shocks
less, and is more easily loved, than one who is laboriously and 
egotistically unselfish.&nbsp; There is at least no fuss about 
the first; but the other parades his sacrifices, and so sells his
favours too dear.&nbsp; Selfishness is calm, a force of nature; 
you might say the trees were selfish.&nbsp; But egotism is a 
piece of vanity; it must always take you into its confidence; it 
is uneasy, troublesome, seeking; it can do good, but not 
handsomely; it is uglier, because less dignified, than 
selfishness itself.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Mr Henley had but had this clear in his mind he might well 
have quoted it in one connection against Stevenson himself in the
<i>Pall Mall Magazine</i> article.&nbsp; He could hardly have 
quoted anything more apparently apt to the purpose.</p>
<p>In the sphere of minor morals there is no more important 
topic.&nbsp; Unselfishness is too often only the most 
exasperating form of selfishness.&nbsp; Here is another very 
characteristic bit:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;You will always do wrong: you must try to 
get used to that, my son.&nbsp; It is a small matter to make a 
work about, when all the world is in the same case.&nbsp; I meant
when I was a young man to write a great poem; and now I am 
cobbling little prose articles and in excellent good 
spirits.&nbsp; I thank you. . . . Our business in life is not to 
succeed, but to continue to fail, in good spirits.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;It is the mark of good action that it 
appears inevitable in the retrospect.&nbsp; We should have been 
cut-throats to do otherwise.&nbsp; And there&rsquo;s an 
end.&nbsp; We ought to know distinctly that we are damned for 
what we do wrong; but when we have done right, we have only been 
gentlemen, after all.&nbsp; There is nothing to make a work 
about.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The moral to <i>The House of Eld</i> is incisive writ out of 
true experience&mdash;phantasy there becomes solemn, if not, for 
the nonce, tragic:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Old is the tree and the fruit good,<br />
Very old and thick the wood.<br />
Woodman, is your courage stout?<br />
Beware! the root is wrapped about<br />
Your mother&rsquo;s heart, your father&rsquo;s bones;<br />
And, like the mandrake, comes with groans.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The phantastic moralist is supreme, jauntily serious, 
facetiously earnest, most gravely funny in the whole series of 
<i>Moral Emblems</i>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Reader, your soul upraise to see,<br />
In yon fair cut designed by me,<br />
The pauper by the highwayside<br />
Vainly soliciting from pride.<br />
Mark how the Beau with easy air<br />
Contemns the anxious rustic&rsquo;s prayer<br />
And casting a disdainful eye<br />
Goes gaily gallivanting by.<br />
He from the poor averts his head . . .<br />
He will regret it when he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, the man who would trace out step by step and point by 
point, clearly and faithfully, the process by which Stevenson 
worked himself so far free of this his besetting tendency to 
moralised symbolism or allegory into the freer air of life and 
real character, would do more to throw light on Stevenson&rsquo;s
genius, and the obstacles he had had to contend with in becoming 
a novelist eager to interpret definite times and character, than 
has yet been done or even faithfully attempted.&nbsp; This would 
show at once Stevenson&rsquo;s wonderful growth and the saving 
grace and elasticity of his temperament and genius.&nbsp; Few men
who have by force of native genius gone into allegory or 
moralised phantasy ever depart out of that fateful and enchanted 
region.&nbsp; They are as it were at once lost and imprisoned in 
it and kept there as by a spell&mdash;the more they struggle for 
freedom the more surely is the bewitching charm laid upon 
them&mdash;they are but like the fly in amber.&nbsp; It was so 
with Ludwig Tieck; it was so with Nathaniel Hawthorne; it was so 
with our own George MacDonald, whose professedly real pictures of
life are all informed of this phantasy, which spoils them for 
what they profess to be, and yet to the discerning cannot 
disguise what they really are&mdash;the attempts of a mystic poet
and phantasy writer and allegoristic moralist to walk in the ways
of Anthony Trollope or of Mrs Oliphant, and, like a stranger in a
new land always looking back (at least by a side-glance, an 
averted or half-averted face which keeps him from seeing steadily
and seeing whole the real world with which now he is fain to 
deal), to the country from which he came.</p>
<p>Stevenson did largely free himself, that is his great 
achievement&mdash;had he lived, we verily believe, so marked was 
his progress, he would have been a great and true realist, a 
profound interpreter of human life and its tragic laws and 
wondrous compensations&mdash;he would have shown how to make the 
full retreat from fairyland without penalty of too early an 
escape from it, as was the case with Thomas the Rymer of 
Ercildoune, and with one other told of by him, and proved that to
have been a dreamer need not absolutely close the door to insight
into the real world and to art.&nbsp; This side of the subject, 
never even glanced at by Mr Henley or Mr Zangwill or their 
<i>confr&egrave;res</i>, yet demands, and will well reward the 
closest and most careful attention and thought that can be given 
to it.</p>
<p>The parabolic element, with the whimsical humour and turn for 
paradoxical inversion, comes out fully in such a work as <i>Dr 
Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i>.&nbsp; There his humour gives body to his 
fancy, and reality to the half-whimsical forms in which he 
embodies the results of deep and earnest speculations on human 
nature and motive.&nbsp; But even when he is professedly 
concerned with incident and adventure merely, he manages to 
communicate to his pages some touch of universality, as of 
unconscious parable or allegory, so that the reader feels now and
then as though some thought, or motive, or aspiration, or 
weakness of his own were being there cunningly unveiled or 
presented; and not seldom you feel he has also unveiled and 
presented some of yours, secret and unacknowledged too.</p>
<p>Hence the interest which young and old alike have felt in 
<i>Treasure Island</i>, <i>Kidnapped</i>, and <i>The 
Wrecker</i>&mdash;a something which suffices decisively to mark 
off these books from the mass with which superficially they might
be classed.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX&mdash;EDMUND CLARENCE STEDMAN&rsquo;S 
ESTIMATE</h2>
<p>It should be clearly remembered that Stevenson died at a 
little over forty&mdash;the age at which severity and simplicity 
and breadth in art but begin to be attained.&nbsp; If Scott had 
died at the age when Stevenson was taken from us, the world would
have lacked the <i>Waverley Novels</i>; if a like fate had 
overtaken Dickens, we should not have had <i>A Tale of Two 
Cities</i>; and under a similar stroke, Goldsmith could not have 
written <i>Retaliation</i>, or tasted the bitter-sweet first 
night of <i>She Stoops to Conquer</i>.&nbsp; At the age of 
forty-four Mr Thomas Hardy had probably not dreamt of <i>Tess of 
the D&rsquo;Urbervilles</i>.&nbsp; But what a man has already 
done at forty years is likely, I am afraid, to be a gauge as well
as a promise of what he will do in the future; and from Stevenson
we were entitled to expect perfect form and continued variety of 
subject, rather than a measurable dynamic gain.</p>
<p>This is the point of view which my friend and correspondent of
years ago, Mr Edmund Clarence Stedman, of New York, set out by 
emphasising in his address, as President of the meeting under the
auspices of the Uncut Leaves Society in New York, in the 
beginning of 1895, on the death of Stevenson, and to honour the 
memory of the great romancer, as reported in the <i>New York 
Tribune</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We are brought together by tidings, almost 
from the Antipodes, of the death of a beloved writer in his early
prime.&nbsp; The work of a romancer and poet, of a man of insight
and feeling, which may be said to have begun but fifteen years 
ago, has ended, through fortune&rsquo;s sternest cynicism, just 
as it seemed entering upon even more splendid achievement.&nbsp; 
A star surely rising, as we thought, has suddenly gone out.&nbsp;
A radiant invention shines no more; the voice is hushed of a 
creative mind, expressing its fine imagining in this, our 
peerless English tongue.&nbsp; His expression was so original and
fresh from Nature&rsquo;s treasure-house, so prodigal and 
various, its too brief flow so consummate through an inborn gift 
made perfect by unsparing toil, that mastery of the art by which 
Robert Louis Stevenson conveyed those imaginings to us so 
picturesque, yet wisely ordered, his own romantic life&mdash;and 
now, at last, so pathetic a loss which renews</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The Virgilian cry,<br />
The sense of tears in mortal things,&rsquo;</p>
<p>that this assemblage has gathered at the first summons, in 
tribute to a beautiful genius, and to avow that with the putting 
out of that bright intelligence the reading world experiences a 
more than wonted grief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judged by the sum of his interrupted work, Stevenson 
had his limitations.&nbsp; But the work was adjusted to the scale
of a possibly long career.&nbsp; As it was, the good fairies 
brought all gifts, save that of health, to his cradle, and the 
gift-spoiler wrapped them in a shroud.&nbsp; Thinking of what his
art seemed leading to&mdash;for things that would be the crowning
efforts of other men seemed prentice-work in his case&mdash;it 
was not safe to bound his limitations.&nbsp; And now it is as if 
Sir Walter, for example, had died at forty-four, with the 
<i>Waverley Novels</i> just begun!&nbsp; In originality, in the 
conception of action and situation, which, however phantastic, 
are seemingly within reason, once we breathe the air of his 
Fancyland; in the union of bracing and heroic character and 
adventure; in all that belongs to tale-writing pure and simple, 
his gift was exhaustless.&nbsp; No other such charmer, in this 
wise, has appeared in his generation.&nbsp; We thought the 
stories, the fairy tales, had all been told, but &lsquo;Once upon
a time&rsquo; meant for him our own time, and the grave and gay 
magic of Prince Florizel in dingy London or sunny France.&nbsp; 
All this is but one of his provinces, however distinctive.&nbsp; 
Besides, how he buttressed his romance with apparent truth!&nbsp;
Since Defoe, none had a better right to say: &lsquo;There was one
thing I determined to do when I began this long story, and that 
was to tell out everything as it befell.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember delighting in two fascinating stories of 
Paris in the time of Fran&ccedil;ois Villon, anonymously 
reprinted by a New York paper from a London magazine.&nbsp; They 
had all the quality, all the distinction, of which I speak.&nbsp;
Shortly afterward I met Mr Stevenson, then in his twenty-ninth 
year, at a London club, where we chanced to be the only loungers 
in an upper room.&nbsp; To my surprise he opened a 
conversation&mdash;you know there could be nothing more 
unexpected than that in London&mdash;and thereby I guessed that 
he was as much, if not as far, away from home as I was.&nbsp; He 
asked many questions concerning &lsquo;the States&rsquo;; in 
fact, this was but a few months before he took his steerage 
passage for our shores.&nbsp; I was drawn to the young Scotsman 
at once.&nbsp; He seemed more like a New-Englander of 
Holmes&rsquo;s Brahmin caste, who might have come from Harvard or
Yale.&nbsp; But as he grew animated I thought, as others have 
thought, and as one would suspect from his name, that he must 
have Scandinavian blood in his veins&mdash;that he was of the 
heroic, restless, strong and tender Viking strain, and certainly 
from that day his works and wanderings have not belied the 
surmise.&nbsp; He told me that he was the author of that charming
book of gipsying in the Cevennes which just then had gained for 
him some attentions from the literary set.&nbsp; But if I had 
known that he had written those two stories of sixteenth-century 
Paris&mdash;as I learned afterwards when they reappeared in the 
<i>New Arabian Nights</i>&mdash;I would not have bidden him 
good-bye as to an &lsquo;unfledged comrade,&rsquo; but would have
wished indeed to &lsquo;grapple him to my soul with hooks of 
steel.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another point is made clear as crystal by his life 
itself.&nbsp; He had the instinct, and he had the courage, to 
make it the servant, and not the master, of the faculty within 
him.&nbsp; I say he had the courage, but so potent was his 
birth-spell that doubtless he could not otherwise.&nbsp; Nothing 
commonplace sufficed him.&nbsp; A regulation stay-at-home life 
would have been fatal to his art.&nbsp; The ancient mandate, 
&lsquo;Follow thy Genius,&rsquo; was well obeyed.&nbsp; 
Unshackled freedom of person and habit was a prerequisite; as an 
imaginary artist he felt&mdash;nature keeps her poets and 
story-tellers children to the last&mdash;he felt, if he ever 
reasoned it out, that he must gang his own gait, whether it 
seemed promising, or the reverse, to kith, kin, or alien.&nbsp; 
So his wanderings were not only in the most natural but in the 
wisest consonance with his creative dreams.&nbsp; Wherever he 
went, he found something essential for his use, breathed upon it,
and returned it fourfold in beauty and worth.&nbsp; The longing 
of the Norseman for the tropic, of the pine for the palm, took 
him to the South Seas.&nbsp; There, too, strange secrets were at 
once revealed to him, and every island became an &lsquo;Isle of 
Voices.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yes, an additional proof of 
Stevenson&rsquo;s artistic mission lay in his careless, careful, 
liberty of life; in that he was an artist no less than in his 
work.&nbsp; He trusted to the impulse which possessed 
him&mdash;that which so many of us have conscientiously disobeyed
and too late have found ourselves in reputable bondage to 
circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But those whom you are waiting to hear will speak more 
fully of all this&mdash;some of them with the interest of their 
personal remembrance&mdash;with the strength of their affection 
for the man beloved by young and old.&nbsp; In the strange and 
sudden intimacy with an author&rsquo;s record which death makes 
sure, we realise how notable the list of Stevenson&rsquo;s works 
produced since 1878; more than a score of books&mdash;not fiction
alone, but also essays, criticism, biography, drama, even 
history, and, as I need not remind you, that spontaneous poetry 
which comes only from a true poet.&nbsp; None can have failed to 
observe that, having recreated the story of adventure, he seemed 
in his later fiction to interfuse a subtler purpose&mdash;the 
search for character, the analysis of mind and soul.&nbsp; Just 
here his summons came.&nbsp; Between the sunrise of one day and 
the sunset of the next he exchanged the forest study for the 
mountain grave.&nbsp; There, as he had sung his own wish, he lies
&lsquo;under the wide and starry sky.&rsquo;&nbsp; If there was 
something of his own romance, so exquisitely capricious, in the 
life of Robert Louis Stevenson, so, also, the poetic conditions 
are satisfied in his death, and in the choice of his burial-place
upon the top of Pala.&nbsp; As for the splendour of that maturity
upon which we counted, now never to be fulfilled on sea or land, 
I say&mdash;as once before, when the great New-England romancer 
passed in the stillness of the night:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What though his work unfinished lies?&nbsp; Half
bent<br />
The rainbow&rsquo;s arch fades out in upper air,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The shining cataract half-way down the height<br />
Breaks into mist; the haunting strain, that fell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On listeners unaware,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ends incomplete, but through the starry night<br />
The ear still waits for what it did not tell.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dr Edward Eggleston finely sounded the personal note, and told
of having met Stevenson at a hotel in New York.&nbsp; Stevenson 
was ill when the landlord came to Dr Eggleston and asked him if 
he should like to meet him.&nbsp; Continuing, he said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He was flat on his back when I entered, but
I think I never saw anybody grow well in so short a time.&nbsp; 
It was a soul rather than a body that lay there, ablaze with 
spiritual fire, good will shining through everywhere.&nbsp; He 
did not pay me any compliment about my work, and I didn&rsquo;t 
pay him any about his.&nbsp; We did not burn any of the incense 
before each other which authors so often think it necessary to 
do, but we were friends instantly.&nbsp; I am not given to speedy
intimacies, but I could not help my heart going out to him.&nbsp;
It was a wonderfully invested soul, no hedges or fences across 
his fields, no concealment.&nbsp; He was a romanticist; I 
was&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know exactly what.&nbsp; But he let
me into the springs of his romanticism then and there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;You go in your boat every day?&rsquo; he 
asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;You sail?&nbsp; Oh! to write a novel a man 
must take his life in his hands.&nbsp; He must not live in the 
town.&rsquo;&nbsp; And so he spoke, in his broad way, of course, 
according to the enthusiasm of the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sound any note of pathos here 
to-night.&nbsp; Some lives are so brave and sweet and joyous and 
well-rounded, with such a completeness about them that death does
not leave imperfection.&nbsp; He never had the air of sitting up 
with his own reputation.&nbsp; He let his books toss in the waves
of criticism and make their ports if they deserve to.&nbsp; He 
had no claptrap, no great cause, none of the disease of pruriency
which came into fashion with Flaubert and Guy de 
Maupassant.&nbsp; He simply told his story, with no 
condescension, taking the readers into his heart and his 
confidence.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XX&mdash;EGOTISTIC ELEMENT AND ITS EFFECTS</h2>
<p>From these sources now traced out by us&mdash;his youthfulness
of spirit, his mystical bias, and tendency to 
dream&mdash;symbolisms leading to disregard of common 
feelings&mdash;flows too often the indeterminateness of 
Stevenson&rsquo;s work, at the very points where for direct 
interest there should be decision.&nbsp; In <i>The Master of 
Ballantrae</i> this leads him to try to bring the balances even 
as regards our interest in the two brothers, in so far justifying
from one point of view what Mr Zangwill said in the quotation we 
have given, or, as Sir Leslie Stephen had it in his second series
of the <i>Studies of a Biographer</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The younger brother in <i>The Master of 
Ballantrae</i>, who is black-mailed by the utterly reprobate 
master, ought surely to be interesting instead of being simply 
sullen and dogged.&nbsp; In the later adventures, we are invited 
to forgive him on the ground that his brain has been affected: 
but the impression upon me is that he is sacrificed throughout to
the interests of the story [or more strictly for the working out 
of the problem as originally conceived by the author].&nbsp; The 
curious exclusion of women is natural in the purely boyish 
stories, since to a boy woman is simply an incumbrance upon 
reasonable modes of life.&nbsp; When in <i>Catriona</i> Stevenson
introduces a love story, it is still unsatisfactory, because 
David Balfour is so much the undeveloped animal that his passion 
is clumsy, and his charm for the girl unintelligible.&nbsp; I 
cannot feel, to say the truth, that in any of these stories I am 
really among living human beings with whom, apart from their 
adventures, I can feel any very lively affection or 
antipathy.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the <i>Ebb-Tide</i> it is, in this respect, yet worse: the 
three heroes choke each other off all too literally.</p>
<p>In his excess of impartiality he tones down the points and 
lines that would give the attraction of true individuality to his
characters, and instead, would fain have us contented with his 
liberal, and even over-sympathetic views of them and allowances 
for them.&nbsp; But instead of thus furthering his object, he 
sacrifices the whole&mdash;and his story becomes, instead of a 
broad and faithful human record, really a curiosity of 
autobiographic perversion, and of overweening, if not extravagant
egotism of the more refined, but yet over-obtrusive kind.</p>
<p>Mr Baildon thus hits the subjective tendency, out of which 
mainly this defect&mdash;a serious defect in view of 
interest&mdash;arises.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;That we can none of us be sure to what 
crime we might not descend, if only our temptation were 
sufficiently acute, lies at the root of his fondness and 
toleration for wrong-doers (p. 74).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus he practically declines to do for us what we are 
unwilling or unable to do for ourselves.&nbsp; Interest in two 
characters in fiction can never, in this artificial way, and if 
they are real characters truly conceived, be made equal, nor can 
one element of claim be balanced against another, even at the 
beck of the greatest artist.&nbsp; The common sentiment, as we 
have seen, resents it even as it resents lack of guidance 
elsewhere.&nbsp; After all, the novelist is bound to give 
guidance: he is an authority in his own world, where he is an 
autocrat indeed; and can work out issues as he pleases, even as 
the Pope is an authority in the Roman Catholic world: he 
abdicates his functions when he declines to lead: we depend on 
him from the human point of view to guide us right, according to 
the heart, if not according to any conventional notion or 
opinion.&nbsp; Stevenson&rsquo;s pause in individual presentation
in the desire now to raise our sympathy for the one, and then for
the other in <i>The Master of Ballantrae</i>, admits us too far 
into Stevenson&rsquo;s secret or trick of affected 
self-withdrawal in order to work his problem and to signify his 
theories, to the loss and utter confusion of his aims from the 
point of common dramatic and human interest.&nbsp; It is the same
in <i>Catriona</i> in much of the treatment of James Mohr or 
More; it is still more so in not a little of the treatment of 
<i>Weir of Hermiston</i> and his son, though there, happily for 
him and for us, there were the direct restrictions of known fact 
and history, and clearly an attempt at a truer and broader human 
conception unburdened by theory or egotistic conception.</p>
<p>Everywhere the problem due to the desire to be overjust, so to
say, emerges; and exactly in the measure it does so the source of
true dramatic directness and variety is lost.&nbsp; It is just as
though Shakespeare were to invent a chorus to cry out at 
intervals about Iago&mdash;&ldquo;a villain, bad lot, you see, 
still there&rsquo;s a great deal to be said for him&mdash;victim 
of inheritance, this, that and the other; and considering 
everything how could you really expect anything else 
now.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thackeray was often weak from this same 
tendency&mdash;he meant Becky Sharp to be largely excused by the 
reader on these grounds, as he tries to excuse several others of 
his characters; but his endeavours in this way to gloss over 
&ldquo;wickedness&rdquo; in a way, do not succeed&mdash;the 
reader does not carry clear in mind as he goes along, the 
suggestions Thackeray has ineffectually set out and the 
&ldquo;healthy hatred of scoundrels&rdquo; Carlyle talked about 
has its full play in spite of Thackeray&rsquo;s suggested excuses
and palliations, and all in his own favour, too, as a 
story-wright.</p>
<p>Stevenson&rsquo;s constant habit of putting himself in the 
place of another, and asking himself how would I have borne 
myself here or there, thus limited his field of dramatic 
interest, where the subject should have been made pre-eminently 
in aid of this effect.&nbsp; Even in Long John Silver we see it, 
as in various others of his characters, though there, owing to 
the demand for adventure, and action contributory to it, the 
defect is not so emphasised.&nbsp; The sense as of a projection 
of certain features of the writer into all and sundry of his 
important characters, thus imparts, if not an air of egotism, 
then most certainly a somewhat constrained, if not somewhat 
artificial, autobiographical air&mdash;in the very midst of 
action, questions of ethical or casuistical character arise, all 
contributing to submerging individual character and its dramatic 
interests under a wave of but half-disguised autobiography.&nbsp;
Let Stevenson do his very best&mdash;let him adopt all the 
artificial disguises he may, as writing narrative in the first 
person, etc., as in <i>Kidnapped</i> and <i>Catriona</i>, 
nevertheless, the attentive reader&rsquo;s mind is constantly 
called off to the man who is actually writing the story.&nbsp; It
is as though, after all, all the artistic or artificial disguises
were a mere mask, as more than once Thackeray represented 
himself, the mask partially moved aside, just enough to show a 
chubby, childish kind of transformed Thackeray face below.&nbsp; 
This belongs, after all, to the order of self-revelation though 
under many disguises: it is creation only in its manner of work, 
not in its essential being&mdash;the spirit does not so to us go 
clean forth of itself, it stops at home, and, as if from a remote
and shadowy cave or recess, projects its own colour on all on 
which it looks.</p>
<p>This is essentially the character of the <i>mystic</i>; and 
hence the justification for this word as applied expressly to 
Stevenson by Mr Chesterton and others.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The inner life like rings of light<br />
Goes forth of us, transfiguring all we see.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The effect of these early days, with the peculiar tint due to 
the questionings raised by religious stress and strain, persists 
with Stevenson; he grows, but he never escapes from that peculiar
something which tells of childish influences&mdash;of boyish 
perversions and troubled self-examinations due to Shorter 
Catechism&mdash;any one who would view Stevenson without thought 
of this, would view him only from the outside&mdash;see him 
merely in dress and outer oddities.&nbsp; Here I see definite and
clear heredity.&nbsp; Much as he differed from his worthy father 
in many things, he was like him in this&mdash;the old man like 
the son, bore on him the marks of early excesses of wistful 
self-questionings and painful wrestlings with religious problems,
that perpetuated themselves in a quaint kind of self-revelation 
often masked by an assumed self-withdrawal or indifference which 
to the keen eye only the more revealed the real case.&nbsp; 
Stevenson never, any more than his father, ceased to be 
interested in the religious questions for which Scotland has 
always had a <i>penchant</i>&mdash;and so much is this the case 
that I could wish Professor Sidney Colvin would even yet attempt 
to show the bearing of certain things in that <i>Address to the 
Scottish Clergy</i> written when Stevenson was yet but a young 
man, on all that he afterwards said and did.&nbsp; It starts in 
the <i>Edinburgh Edition</i> without any note, comment, or 
explanation whatever, but in that respect the <i>Edinburgh 
Edition</i> is not quite so complete as it might have been 
made.&nbsp; In view of the point now before us, it is far more 
important than many of the other trifles there given, and wants 
explanation and its relation to much in the novels brought out 
and illustrated.&nbsp; Were this adequately done, only new ground
would be got for holding that Stevenson, instead of, as has been 
said, &ldquo;seeing only the visible world,&rdquo; was, in truth,
a mystical moralist, once and always, whose thoughts ran all too 
easily into parable and fable, and who, indeed, never escaped 
wholly from that atmosphere, even when writing of things and 
characters that seemed of themselves to be wholly outside that 
sphere.&nbsp; This was the tendency, indeed, that militated 
against the complete detachment in his case from moral problems 
and mystical thought, so as to enable him to paint, as it were, 
with a free hand exactly as he saw; and most certainly not that 
he saw only the visible world.&nbsp; The mystical element is not 
directly favourable to creative art.&nbsp; You see in Tolstoy how
it arrests and perplexes&mdash;how it lays a disturbing check on 
real presentation&mdash;hindering the action, and is not 
favourable to the loving and faithful representation, which, as 
Goethe said, all true and high art should be.&nbsp; To some 
extent you see exactly the same thing in Nathaniel Hawthorne as 
in Tolstoy.&nbsp; Hawthorne&rsquo;s preoccupations in this way 
militated against his character-power; his healthy characters who
would never have been influenced as he describes by morbid ones 
yet are not only influenced according to him, but suffer 
sadly.&nbsp; Phoebe Pyncheon in <i>The House of the Seven 
Gables</i>, gives sunshine to poor Hepzibah Clifford, but is 
herself never merry again, though joyousness was her natural 
element.&nbsp; So, doubtless, it would have been with Pansie in 
<i>Doctor Dolliver</i>, as indeed it was with Zenobia and with 
the hero in the <i>Marble Faun</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;We all go 
wrong,&rdquo; said Hawthorne, &ldquo;by a too strenuous 
resolution to go right.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lady Byron was to him an 
intolerably irreproachable person, just as Stevenson felt a 
little of the same towards Thoreau; notwithstanding that he was 
the &ldquo;sunnily-ascetic,&rdquo; the asceticism and its 
corollary, as he puts it: the passion for individual 
self-improvement was alien in a way to Stevenson.&nbsp; This is 
the position of the casuistic mystic moralist and not of the man 
who sees only the visible world.</p>
<p>Mr Baildon says:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Stevenson has many of the things that are 
wanting or defective in Scott.&nbsp; He has his philosophy of 
life; he is beyond remedy a moralist, even when his morality is 
of the kind which he happily calls &lsquo;tail foremost,&rsquo; 
or as we may say, inverted morality.&nbsp; Stevenson is, in fact,
much more of a thinker than Scott, and he is also much more of 
the conscious artist, questionable advantage as that sometimes 
is.&nbsp; He has also a much cleverer, acuter mind than Scott, 
also a questionable advantage, as genius has no greater enemy 
than cleverness, and there is really no greater descent than to 
fall from the style of genius to that of cleverness.&nbsp; But 
Stevenson was too critical and alive to misuse his cleverness, 
and it is generally employed with great effect as in the 
diabolical ingenuities of a John Silver, or a Master of 
Ballantrae.&nbsp; In one sense Stevenson does not even belong to 
the school of Scott, but rather to that of Poe, Hawthorne, and 
the Bront&euml;s, in that he aims more at concentration and 
intensity, than at the easy, quiet breadth of Scott.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If, indeed, it should not here have been added that 
Stevenson&rsquo;s theory of life and conduct was not seldom too 
insistent for free creativeness, for dramatic freedom, breadth 
and reality.</p>
<p>Now here I humbly think Mr Baldion errs about the cleverness 
when he criticises Stevenson for the <i>faux pas</i> artistically
of resorting to the piratic filibustering and the 
treasure-seeking at the close of <i>The Master of Ballantrae</i>,
he only tells and tells plainly how cleverness took the place of 
genius there; as indeed it did in not a few cases&mdash;certainly
in some points in the Dutch escapade in <i>Catriona</i> and in 
not a few in <i>Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i>.&nbsp; The fault of 
that last story is simply that we seem to hear Stevenson 
chuckling to himself, &ldquo;Ah, now, won&rsquo;t they all say at
last how clever I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; That too mars the <i>Merry 
Men</i>, whoever wrote them or part wrote them, and <i>Prince 
Otto</i> would have been irretrievably spoiled by this 
self-conscious sense of cleverness had it not been for style and 
artifice.&nbsp; In this incessant &ldquo;see how clever I 
am,&rdquo; we have another proof of the abounding youthfulness of
R. L. Stevenson.&nbsp; If, as Mr Baildon says (p. 30), he had 
true child&rsquo;s horror of being put in fine clothes in which 
one must sit still and be good, <i>Prince Otto</i> remains 
attractive in spite of some things and because of his fine 
clothes.&nbsp; Neither Poe nor Hawthorne could have fallen to the
piracy, and treasure-hunting of <i>The Master of 
Ballantrae</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far behind Scott in the power of instinctive, 
irreflective, spontaneous creation of character, Stevenson tells 
his story with more art and with a firmer grip on his 
reader.&rdquo;&nbsp; And that is exactly what I, wishing to do 
all I dutifully can for Stevenson, cannot see.&nbsp; His genius 
is in nearly all cases pulled up or spoiled by his all too 
conscious cleverness, and at last we say, &ldquo;Oh Heavens! if 
he could and would but let himself go or forget himself what he 
might achieve.&rdquo;&nbsp; But he doesn&rsquo;t&mdash;never 
does, and therefore remains but a second-rate creator though more
and more the stylist and the artist.&nbsp; This is more 
especially the case at the very points where writers like Scott 
would have risen and roused all the readers&rsquo; 
interest.&nbsp; When Stevenson reaches such points, he is always 
as though saying &ldquo;See now how cleverly I&rsquo;ll clear 
that old and stereotyped style of thing and do something 
<i>new</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; But there are things in life and human 
nature, which though they are old are yet ever new, and the true 
greatness of a writer can never come from evading or looking 
askance at them or trying to make them out something else than 
what they really are.&nbsp; No artistic aim or ambition can 
suffice to stand instead of them or to refine them away.&nbsp; 
That way lies only cold artifice and frigid lacework, and 
sometimes Stevenson did go a little too much on this line.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI&mdash;UNITY IN STEVENSON&rsquo;S STORIES</h2>
<p>The unity in Stevenson&rsquo;s stories is generally a unity of
subjective impression and reminiscence due, in the first place, 
to his quick, almost abnormal boyish reverence for mere animal 
courage, audacity, and doggedness, and, in the second place, to 
his theory of life, his philosophy, his moral view.&nbsp; He 
produces an artificial atmosphere.&nbsp; Everything then has to 
be worked up to this&mdash;kept really in accordance with it, and
he shows great art in the doing of this.&nbsp; Hence, though, a 
quaint sense of sameness, of artificial atmosphere&mdash;at once 
really a lack of spontaneity and of freedom.&nbsp; He is freest 
when he pretends to nothing but adventure&mdash;when he aims 
professedly at nothing save to let his characters develop 
themselves by action.&nbsp; In this respect the most successful 
of his stories is yet <i>Treasure Island</i>, and the least 
successful perhaps <i>Catriona</i>, when just as the ambitious 
aim compels him to pause in incident, the first-person form 
creates a cold stiffness and artificiality alien to the full 
impression he would produce upon the reader.&nbsp; The two 
stories he left unfinished promised far greater things in this 
respect than he ever accomplished.&nbsp; For it is an 
indisputable fact, and indeed very remarkable, that the ordinary 
types of men and women have little or no attraction for 
Stevenson, nor their commonplace passions either.&nbsp; Yet 
precisely what his art wanted was due infusion of this very 
interest.&nbsp; Nothing else will supply the place.&nbsp; The 
ordinary passion of love to the end he <i>shies</i>, and must 
invent no end of expedients to supply the want.&nbsp; The 
devotion of the ordinary type, as Thomas Hardy has over and over 
exhibited it, is precisely what Stevenson wants, to impart to his
novels the full sense of reality.&nbsp; The secret of morals, 
says Shelley, is a going out of self.&nbsp; Stevenson was only on
the way to secure this grand and all-sufficing motive.&nbsp; His 
characters, in a way, are all already like himself, romantic, but
the highest is when the ordinary and commonplace is so 
apprehended that it becomes romantic, and may even, through the 
artist&rsquo;s deeper perception and unconscious grasp and 
vision, take the hand of tragedy, and lose nothing.&nbsp; The 
very atmosphere Stevenson so loved to create was in itself alien 
to this; and, so far as he went, his most successful revelations 
were but records of his own limitations.&nbsp; It is something 
that he was to the end so much the youth, with fine impulses, if 
sometimes with sympathies misdirected, and that, too, in such a 
way as to render his work cold and artificial, else he might have
turned out more of the Swift than of the Sterne or 
Fielding.&nbsp; Prince Otto and Seraphina are from this cause 
mainly complete failures, alike from the point of view of nature 
and of art, and the Countess von Rosen is not a complete failure,
and would perhaps have been a bit of a success, if only she had 
made Prince Otto come nearer to losing his virtue.&nbsp; The most
perfect in style, perhaps, of all Stevenson&rsquo;s efforts it is
yet most out of nature and truth,&mdash;a farce, felt to be 
disguised only when read in a certain mood; and this all the more
for its perfections, just as Stevenson would have said it of a 
human being too icily perfect whom he had met.</p>
<p>On this subject, Mr Baildon has some words so decisive, true, 
and final, that I cannot refrain from here quoting them:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;From sheer incapacity to retain it, Prince 
Otto loses the regard, affection, and esteem of his wife.&nbsp; 
He goes eavesdropping among the peasantry, and has to sit silent 
while his wife&rsquo;s honour is coarsely impugned.&nbsp; After 
that I hold it is impossible for Stevenson to rehabilitate his 
hero, and, with all his brilliant effects, he fails. . . . I 
cannot help feeling a regret that such fine work is thrown away 
on what I must honestly hold to be an unworthy subject.&nbsp; The
music of the spheres is rather too sublime an accompaniment for 
this genteel comedy Princess.&nbsp; A touch of Offenbach would 
seem more appropriate.&nbsp; Then even in comedy the hero must 
not be the butt.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it must reluctantly be 
confessed that in Prince Otto you see in excess that to which 
there is a tendency in almost all the rest&mdash;it is to make up
for lack of hold on human nature itself, by resources of style 
and mere external technical art.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XXII&mdash;PERSONAL CHEERFULNESS AND INVENTED 
GLOOM</h2>
<p>Now, it is in its own way surely a very remarkable thing that 
Stevenson, who, like a youth, was all for <i>Heiterkeit</i>, 
cheerfulness, taking and giving of pleasure, for relief, change, 
variety, new impressions, new sensations, should, at the time he 
did, have conceived and written a story like <i>The Master of 
Ballantrae</i>&mdash;all in a grave, grey, sombre tone, not 
aiming even generally at what at least indirectly all art is 
conceived to aim at&mdash;the giving of pleasure: he himself 
decisively said that it &ldquo;lacked all pleasurableness, and 
hence was imperfect in essence.&rdquo;&nbsp; A very strange 
utterance in face of the oft-repeated doctrine of the essays that
the one aim of art, as of true life, is to communicate pleasure, 
to cheer and to elevate and improve, and in face of two of his 
doctrines that life itself is a monitor to cheerfulness and 
mirth.&nbsp; This is true: and it is only explainable on the 
ground that it is youth alone which can exult in its power of 
accumulating shadows and dwelling on the dark side&mdash;it is 
youth that revels in the possible as a set-off to its brightness 
and irresponsibility: it is youth that can delight in its own 
excess of shade, and can even dispense with 
sunshine&mdash;hugging to its heart the memory of its own often 
self-created distresses and conjuring up and, with 
self-satisfaction, brooding over the pain and imagined horrors of
a lifetime.&nbsp; Maturity and age kindly bring their own 
relief&mdash;rendering this kind of ministry to itself no longer 
desirable, even were it possible.&nbsp; <i>The Master of 
Ballantrae</i> indeed marks the crisis.&nbsp; It shows, and 
effectively shows, the other side of the adventure 
passion&mdash;the desire of escape from its own sombre 
introspections, which yet, in all its &ldquo;go&rdquo; and glow 
and glitter, tells by its very excess of their tendency to pass 
into this other and apparently opposite.&nbsp; But here, too, 
there is nothing single or separate.&nbsp; The device of piracy, 
etc., at close of <i>Ballantrae</i>, is one of the poorest 
expedients for relief in all fiction.</p>
<p>Will in <i>Will o&rsquo; the Mill</i> presents another.&nbsp; 
When at the last moment he decides that it is not worth while to 
get married, the author&rsquo;s then rather incontinent 
philosophy&mdash;which, by-the-bye, he did not himself act 
on&mdash;spoils his story as it did so much else.&nbsp; Such an 
ending to such a romance is worse even than any blundering such 
as the commonplace inventor could be guilty of, for he would be 
in a low sense natural if he were but commonplace.&nbsp; We need 
not therefore be surprised to find Mr Gwynn thus writing:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The love scenes in <i>Weir of Hermiston</i>
are almost unsurpassable; but the central interest of the story 
lies elsewhere&mdash;in the relations between father and 
son.&nbsp; Whatever the cause, the fact is clear that in the last
years of his life Stevenson recognised in himself an ability to 
treat subjects which he had hitherto avoided, and was thus no 
longer under the necessity of detaching fragments from 
life.&nbsp; Before this, he had largely confined himself to the 
adventures of roving men where women had made no entrance; or, if
he treated of a settled family group, the result was what we see 
in <i>The Master of Ballantrae</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In a word, between this work and <i>Weir of Hermiston</i> we 
have the passage from mere youth to manhood, with its wider, 
calmer views, and its patience, inclusiveness, and mild, genial 
acceptance of types that before did not come, and could not by 
any effort of will be brought, within range or made to adhere 
consistently with what was already accepted and workable.&nbsp; 
He was less the egotist now and more the realist.&nbsp; He was 
not so prone to the high lights in which all seems overwrought, 
exaggerated; concerned really with effects of a more subdued 
order, if still the theme was a wee out of ordinary nature.&nbsp;
Enough is left to prove that Stevenson&rsquo;s life-long devotion
to his art anyway was on the point of being rewarded by such a 
success as he had always dreamt of: that in the man&rsquo;s 
nature there was power to conceive scenes of a tragic beauty and 
intensity unsurpassed in our prose literature, and to create 
characters not unworthy of his greatest predecessors.&nbsp; The 
blind stroke of fate had nothing to say to the lesson of his 
life, and though we deplore that he never completed his 
masterpieces, we may at least be thankful that time enough was 
given him to prove to his fellow-craftsmen, that such labour for 
the sake of art is not without art&rsquo;s peculiar 
reward&mdash;the triumph of successful execution.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII&mdash;EDINBURGH REVIEWERS&rsquo; DICTA 
INAPPLICABLE TO LATER WORK</h2>
<p>From many different points of view discerning critics have 
celebrated the autobiographic vein&mdash;the self-revealing turn,
the self-portraiture, the quaint, genial, yet really child-like 
egotistic and even dreamy element that lies like an amalgam, 
behind all Stevenson&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; Some have even said, 
that because of this, he will finally live by his essays and not 
by his stories.&nbsp; That is extreme, and is not critically 
based or justified, because, however true it may be up to a 
certain point, it is not true of Stevenson&rsquo;s quite latest 
fictions where we see a decided breaking through of the old 
limits, and an advance upon a new and a fresher and broader 
sphere of interest and character altogether.&nbsp; But these 
ideas set down truly enough at a certain date, or prior to a 
certain date, are wrong and falsely directed in view of 
Stevenson&rsquo;s latest work and what it promised.&nbsp; For 
instance, what a discerning and able writer in the <i>Edinburgh 
Review</i> of July 1895 said truly then was in great part utterly
inapplicable to the whole of the work of the last years, for in 
it there was grasp, wide and deep, of new 
possibilities&mdash;promise of clear insight, discrimination, and
contrast of character, as well as firm hold of new and great 
human interest under which the egotistic or autobiographic vein 
was submerged or weakened.&nbsp; The <i>Edinburgh Reviewer</i> 
wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There was irresistible fascination in what 
it would be unfair to characterise as egotism, for it came 
natural to him to talk frankly and easily of himself. . . . He 
could never have dreamed, like Pepys, of locking up his 
confidence in a diary.&nbsp; From first to last, in inconsecutive
essays, in the records of sentimental touring, in fiction and in 
verse, he has embodied the outer and the inner 
autobiography.&nbsp; He discourses&mdash;he prattles&mdash;he 
almost babbles about himself.&nbsp; He seems to have taken minute
and habitual introspection for the chief study in his analysis of
human nature, as a subject which was immediately in his reach, 
and would most surely serve his purpose.&nbsp; We suspect much of
the success of his novels was due to the fact that as he seized 
for a substructure on the scenery and situations which had 
impressed him forcibly, so in the characters of the most 
different types, there was always more or less of 
self-portraiture.&nbsp; The subtle touch, eminently and 
unmistakably realistic, gave life to what might otherwise have 
seemed a lay-figure. . . . He hesitated again and again as to his
destination; and under mistakes, advice of friends, doubted his 
chances, as a story-writer, even after <i>Treasure Island</i> had
enjoyed its special success. . . . We venture to think that, with
his love of intellectual self-indulgence, had he found 
novel-writing really enjoyable, he would never have doubted at 
all.&nbsp; But there comes in the difference between him and 
Scott, whom he condemns for the slovenliness of hasty 
workmanship.&nbsp; Scott, in his best days, sat down to his desk 
and let the swift pen take its course in inspiration that seemed 
to come without an effort.&nbsp; Even when racked with pains, and
groaning in agony, the intellectual machinery was still driven at
a high pressure by something that resembled an irrepressible 
instinct.&nbsp; Stevenson can have had little or nothing of that 
inspiriting afflatus.&nbsp; He did his painstaking work 
conscientiously, thoughtfully; he erased, he revised, and he was 
hard to satisfy.&nbsp; In short, it was his weird&mdash;and he 
could not resist it&mdash;to set style and form before fire and 
spirit.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV&mdash;MR HENLEY&rsquo;S SPITEFUL 
PERVERSIONS</h2>
<p>More unfortunate still, as disturbing and prejudicing a sane 
and true and disinterested view of Stevenson&rsquo;s claims, was 
that article of his erewhile &ldquo;friend,&rdquo; Mr W. E. 
Henley, published on the appearance of the <i>Memoir</i> by Mr 
Graham Balfour, in the <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>.&nbsp; It was 
well that Mr Henley there acknowledged frankly that he wrote 
under a keen sense of &ldquo;grievance&rdquo;&mdash;a most 
dangerous mood for the most soberly critical and self-restrained 
of men to write in, and that most certainly Mr W. E. Henley was 
not&mdash;and that he owned to having lost contact with, and 
recognition of the R. L. Stevenson who went to America in 1887, 
as he says, and never came back again.&nbsp; To do bare justice 
to Stevenson it is clear that knowledge of that later Stevenson 
was essential&mdash;essential whether it was calculated to deepen
sympathy or the reverse.&nbsp; It goes without saying that the 
Louis he knew and hobnobbed with, and nursed near by the Old 
Bristo Port in Edinburgh could not be the same exactly as the 
Louis of Samoa and later years&mdash;to suppose so, or to expect 
so, would simply be to deny all room for growth and 
expansion.&nbsp; It is clear that the W. E. Henley of those days 
was not the same as the W. E. Henley who indited that article, 
and if growth and further insight are to be allowed to Mr Henley 
and be pleaded as his justification <i>cum</i> spite born of 
sense of grievance for such an onslaught, then clearly some 
allowance in the same direction must be made for Stevenson.&nbsp;
One can hardly think that in his case old affection and 
friendship had been so completely submerged, under feelings of 
grievance and paltry pique, almost always bred of grievances 
dwelt on and nursed, which it is especially bad for men of genius
to acknowledge, and to make a basis, as it were, for clearer 
knowledge, insight, and judgment.&nbsp; In other cases the 
pleading would simply amount to an immediate and complete arrest 
of judgment.&nbsp; Mr Henley throughout writes as though whilst 
he had changed, and changed in points most essential, his 
erewhile friend remained exactly where he was as to literary 
position and product&mdash;the Louis who went away in 1887 and 
never returned, had, as Mr W. E. Henley, most unfortunately for 
himself, would imply, retained the mastery, and the Louis who 
never came back had made no progress, had not added an inch, not 
to say a cubit, to his statue, while Mr Henley remained <i>in 
statu quo</i>, and was so only to be judged.&nbsp; It is an 
instance of the imperfect sympathy which Charles Lamb finely 
celebrated&mdash;only here it is acknowledged, and the 
&ldquo;imperfect sympathy&rdquo; pled as a ground for claiming 
the full insight which only sympathy can secure.&nbsp; If Mr 
Henley was fair to the Louis he knew and loved, it is clear that 
he was and could only be unjust to the Louis who went away in 
1887 and never came back.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;At bottom Stevenson was an excellent 
fellow.&nbsp; But he was of his essence what the French call 
<i>personnel</i>.&nbsp; He was, that is, incessantly and 
passionately interested in Stevenson.&nbsp; He could not be in 
the same room with a mirror but he must invite its confidences 
every time he passed it; to him there was nothing obvious in time
and eternity, and the smallest of his discoveries, his most 
trivial apprehensions, were all by way of being revelations, and 
as revelations must be thrust upon the world; he was never so 
much in earnest, never so well pleased (this were he happy or 
wretched), never so irresistible as when he wrote about 
himself.&nbsp; <i>Withal</i>, <i>if he wanted a thing</i>, <i>he 
went after it with an entire contempt of consequences</i>.&nbsp; 
<i>For these</i>, <i>indeed</i>, <i>the Shorter Catechism was 
ever prepared to answer</i>; <i>so that whether he did well or 
ill</i>, <i>he was safe to come out unabashed and 
cheerful</i>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice here, how undiscerning the mentor becomes.&nbsp; The 
words put in &ldquo;italics,&rdquo; unqualified as they are, 
would fit and admirably cover the character of the greatest 
criminal.&nbsp; They would do as they stand, for Wainwright, for 
Dr Dodd, for Deeming, for Neil Cream, for Canham Read, or for 
Dougal of Moat Farm fame.&nbsp; And then the touch that, in the 
Shorter Catechism, Stevenson would have found a cover or 
justification for it somehow!&nbsp; This comes of writing under a
keen sense of grievance; and how could this be truly said of one 
who was &ldquo;at bottom an excellent fellow.&rdquo;&nbsp; W. 
Henley&rsquo;s ethics are about as clear-obscure as is his 
reading of character.&nbsp; Listen to him once again&mdash;more 
directly on the literary point.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;To tell the truth, his books are none of 
mine; I mean that if I wanted reading, I do not go for it to the 
<i>Edinburgh Edition</i>.&nbsp; I am not interested in remarks 
about morals; in and out of letters.&nbsp; <i>I have lived a full
and varied life</i>, and my opinions are my own.&nbsp; <i>So</i>,
<i>if I crave the enchantment of romance</i>, <i>I ask it of 
bigger men than he</i>, <i>and of bigger books than his</i>: of 
<i>Esmond</i> (say) and <i>Great Expectations</i>, of 
<i>Redgauntlet</i> and <i>Old Mortality</i>, <i>of La Reine 
Margot</i> and <i>Bragelonne</i>, of <i>David Copperfield</i> and
<i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>; while if good writing and some other
things be in my appetite, are there not always Hazlitt and 
Lamb&mdash;to say nothing of that globe of miraculous continents;
which is known to us as Shakespeare?&nbsp; There is his style, 
you will say, and it is a fact that it is rare, and <i>in the 
last</i> times better, because much simpler than in the 
first.&nbsp; But, after all, his style is so perfectly achieved 
that the achievement gets obvious: and when achievement gets 
obvious, is it not by way of becoming uninteresting?&nbsp; And is
there not something to be said for the person who wrote that 
Stevenson always reminded him of a young man dressed the best he 
ever saw for the Burlington Arcade? <a name="citation10"></a><a 
href="#footnote10" class="citation">[10]</a>&nbsp; 
Stevenson&rsquo;s work in letters does not now take me much, and 
I decline to enter on the question of his immortality; since 
that, despite what any can say, will get itself settled soon or 
late, for all time.&nbsp; No&mdash;when I care to think of 
Stevenson it is not of R. L. Stevenson&mdash;R. L. Stevenson, the
renowned, the accomplished&mdash;executing his difficult solo, 
but of the Lewis that I knew and loved, and wrought for, and 
worked with for so long.&nbsp; The successful man of letters does
not greatly interest me.&nbsp; I read his careful prayers and 
pass on, with the certainty that, well as they read, they were 
not written for print.&nbsp; I learn of his nameless 
prodigalities, and recall some instances of conduct in another 
vein.&nbsp; I remember, rather, the unmarried and irresponsible 
Lewis; the friend, the comrade, the <i>charmeur</i>.&nbsp; Truly,
that last word, French as it is, is the only one that is worthy 
of him.&nbsp; I shall ever remember him as that.&nbsp; The 
impression of his writings disappears; the impression of himself 
and his talk is ever a possession. . . . Forasmuch as he was 
primarily a talker, his printed works, like these of others after
his kind, are but a sop for posterity.&nbsp; A last dying speech 
and confession (as it were) to show that not for nothing were 
they held rare fellows in their day.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just a month or two before Mr Henley&rsquo;s self-revealing 
article appeared in the <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>, Mr Chesterton,
in the <i>Daily News</i>, with almost prophetic forecast, had 
said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr Henley might write an excellent study of
Stevenson, but it would only be of the Henleyish part of 
Stevenson, and it would show a distinct divergence from the 
finished portrait of Stevenson, which would be given by Professor
Colvin.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it were indeed hard to reconcile some things here with 
what Mr Henley set down of individual works many times in the 
<i>Scots and National Observer</i>, and elsewhere, and in 
literary judgments as in some other things there should, at 
least, be general consistency, else the search for an honest man 
in the late years would be yet harder than it was when Diogenes 
looked out from his tub!</p>
<p>Mr James Douglas, in the <i>Star</i>, in his half-playful and 
suggestive way, chose to put it as though he regarded the article
in the <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i> as a hoax, perpetrated by some 
clever, unscrupulous writer, intent on provoking both Mr Henley 
and his friends, and Stevenson&rsquo;s friends and 
admirers.&nbsp; This called forth a letter from one signing 
himself &ldquo;A Lover of R. L. Stevenson,&rdquo; which is so 
good that we must give it here.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">A LITERARY HOAX.<br />
TO THE EDITOR OF THE <i>STAR</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;I fear that, despite the 
charitable scepticism of Mr Douglas, there is no doubt that Mr 
Henley is the perpetrator of the saddening Depreciation of 
Stevenson which has been published over his name.</p>
<p>What openings there are for reprisals let Mr Henley&rsquo;s 
conscience tell him; but permit me to remind him of two or three 
things which R. L. Stevenson has written concerning W. E. 
Henley.</p>
<p>First this scene in the infirmary at Edinburgh:</p>
<p>&ldquo;(Leslie) Stephen and I sat on a couple of chairs, and 
the poor fellow (Henley) sat up in his bed with his hair and 
beard all tangled, and talked as cheerfully as if he had been in 
a king&rsquo;s palace, or the great King&rsquo;s palace of the 
blue air.&nbsp; He has taught himself two languages since he has 
been lying there.&nbsp; <i>I shall try to be of use to 
him</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Secondly, this passage from Stevenson&rsquo;s dedication of 
<i>Virginibus Puerisque</i> to &ldquo;My dear William Ernest 
Henley&rdquo;:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These papers are like milestones on the wayside of my 
life; and as I look back in memory, there is hardly a stage of 
that distance but I see you present with advice, reproof, or 
praise.&nbsp; Meanwhile, many things have changed, you and I 
among the rest; but I hope that our sympathy, founded on the love
of our art, and nourished by mutual assistance, shall survive 
these little revolutions, undiminished, and, with God&rsquo;s 
help, unite us to the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thirdly, two scraps from letters from Stevenson to Henley, to 
show that the latter was not always a depreciator of R. L. 
Stevenson&rsquo;s work:</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. I&rsquo;m glad to think I owe you the review that 
pleased me best of all the reviews I ever had. . . . To live 
reading such reviews and die eating ortolans&mdash;sich is my 
aspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. Dear lad,&mdash;If there was any more praise in what
you wrote, I think&mdash;(the editor who had pruned down Mr 
Henley&rsquo;s review of Stevenson&rsquo;s <i>Prince Otto</i>) 
has done us both a service; some of it stops my throat. . . . 
Whether (considering our intimate relations) you would not do 
better to refrain from reviewing me, I will leave to 
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, lastly, this extract from the very last of 
Stevenson&rsquo;s letters to Henley, published in the two volumes
of <i>Letters</i>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is impossible to let your new volume pass in 
silence.&nbsp; I have not received the same thrill of poetry 
since G. M.&rsquo;s <i>Joy of Earth</i> volume, and <i>Love in a 
Valley</i>; and I do not know that even that was so intimate and 
deep. . . . I thank you for the joy you have given me, and remain
your old friend and present huge admirer, R. L. S.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is difficult to decide on which side in this literary 
friendship lies the true modesty and magnanimity?&nbsp; I had 
rather be the author of the last message of R. L. Stevenson to W.
E. Henley, than of the last words of W. E. Henley concerning R. 
L. Stevenson.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXV&mdash;MR CHRISTIE MURRAY&rsquo;S IMPRESSIONS</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr Christie Murray</span>, writing as 
&ldquo;Merlin&rdquo; in our handbook in the <i>Referee</i> at the
time, thus disposed of some of the points just dealt with by 
us:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Here is libel on a large scale, and I have 
purposely refrained from approaching it until I could show my 
readers something of the spirit in which the whole attack is 
conceived.&nbsp; &lsquo;If he wanted a thing he went after it 
with an entire contempt for consequences.&nbsp; For these, 
indeed, the Shorter Catechist was ever prepared to answer; so 
that whether he did well or ill, he was safe to come out 
unabashed and cheerful.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now if Mr Henley does not 
mean that for the very express picture of a rascal without a 
conscience he has been most strangely infelicitous in his choice 
of terms, and he is one of those who make so strong a profession 
of duty towards mere vocables that we are obliged to take him 
<i>au pied de la lettre</i>.&nbsp; A man who goes after whatever 
he wants with an entire contempt of consequences is a scoundrel, 
and the man who emerges from such an enterprise unabashed and 
cheerful, whatever his conduct may have been, and justifies 
himself on the principles of the Shorter Catechism, is a 
hypocrite to boot.&nbsp; This is not the report we have of Robert
Louis Stevenson from most of those who knew him.&nbsp; It is a 
most grave and dreadful accusation, and it is not minimised by Mr
Henley&rsquo;s acknowledgment that Stevenson was a good 
fellow.&nbsp; We all know the air of false candour which lends a 
disputant so much advantage in debate.&nbsp; In Victor 
Hugo&rsquo;s tremendous indictment of Napol&eacute;on le Petit we
remember the telling allowance for fine horsemanship.&nbsp; It 
spreads an air of impartiality over the most mordant of 
Hugo&rsquo;s pages.&nbsp; It is meant to do that.&nbsp; An 
insignificant praise is meant to show how a whole Niagara of 
blame is poured on the victim of invective in all sincerity, and 
even with a touch of reluctance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Henley, despite his absurdities of 
&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis&rsquo; and &lsquo;it were,&rsquo; is a fairly 
competent literary craftsman, and he is quite gifted enough to 
make a plain man&rsquo;s plain meaning an evident thing if he 
chose to do it.&nbsp; But if for the friend for whom &lsquo;first
and last he did share&rsquo; he can only show us the figure of 
one &lsquo;who was at bottom an excellent fellow,&rsquo; and who 
had &lsquo;an entire contempt&rsquo; for the consequences of his 
own acts, he presents a picture which can only purposely be 
obscured. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;All I know of Robert Louis Stevenson I have learned 
from his books, and from one unexpected impromptu letter which he
wrote to me years ago in friendly recognition of my own 
work.&nbsp; I add the testimonies of friends who may have been of
less actual service to him than Mr Henley, but who surely loved 
him better and more lastingly.&nbsp; These do not represent him 
as the victim of an overweening personal vanity, nor as a person 
reckless of the consequences of his own acts, nor as a Pecksniff 
who consoled himself for moral failure out of the Shorter 
Catechism.&nbsp; The books and the friends amongst them show me 
an erratic yet lovable personality, a man of devotion and 
courage, a loyal, charming, and rather irresponsible person whose
very slight faults were counter-balanced many times over by very 
solid virtues. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;To put the thing flatly, it is not a heroism to cling 
to mere existence.&nbsp; The basest of us can do that.&nbsp; But 
it is a heroism to maintain an equable and unbroken cheerfulness 
in the face of death.&nbsp; For my own part, I never bowed at the
literary shrine Mr Henley and his friends were at so great pains 
to rear.&nbsp; I am not disposed to think more loftily than I 
ever thought of their idol.&nbsp; But the Man&mdash;the Man was 
made of enduring valour and childlike charm, and these will keep 
him alive when his detractors are dead and buried.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to the Christian name, it is notorious that he was 
christened Robert Lewis&mdash;the Lewis being after his maternal 
grandfather&mdash;Dr Lewis Balfour.&nbsp; Some attempt has been 
made to show that the Louis was adopted because so many cousins 
and relatives had also been so christened; but the most likely 
explanation I have ever heard was that his father changed the 
name to Louis, that there might be no chance through it of any 
notion of association with a very prominent noisy person of the 
name of Lewis, in Edinburgh, towards whom Thomas Stevenson felt 
dislike, if not positive animosity.&nbsp; Anyhow, it is clear 
from the entries in the register of pupils at the Edinburgh 
Academy, in the two years when Stevenson was there, that in early
youth he was called Robert only; for in the school list for 1862 
the name appears as Robert Stevenson, without the Lewis, while in
the 1883 list it is given as Lewis Robert Stevenson.&nbsp; 
Clearly if in earlier years Stevenson was, in his family and 
elsewhere, called <i>Robert</i>, there could have then arisen no 
risk of confusion with any of his relatives who bore the name of 
Lewis; and all this goes to support the view which I have given 
above.&nbsp; Anyhow he ceased to be called Robert at home, and 
ceased in 1863 to be Robert on the Edinburgh Academy list, and 
became Lewis Robert.&nbsp; Whether my view is right or not, he 
was thenceforward called Louis in his family, and the name 
uniformly spelt Louis.&nbsp; What blame on Stevenson&rsquo;s part
could be attached to this family determination it is hard to 
see&mdash;people are absolutely free to spell their names as they
please, and the matter would not be worth a moment&rsquo;s 
attention, or the waste of one drop of ink, had not Mr Henley 
chosen to be very nasty about the name, and in the <i>Pall Mall 
Magazine</i> article persisted in printing it Lewis as though 
that were worthy of him and of it.&nbsp; That was not quite the 
unkindest cut of all, but it was as unkind as it was 
trumpery.&nbsp; Mr Christie Murray neatly set off the trumpery 
spite of this in the following passage:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Stevenson, it appears, according to his 
friend&rsquo;s judgment, was &lsquo;incessantly and passionately 
interested in Stevenson,&rsquo; but most of us are incessantly 
and passionately interested in ourselves.&nbsp; &lsquo;He could 
not be in the same room with a mirror but he must invite its 
confidences every time he passed it.&rsquo;&nbsp; I remember that
George Sala, who was certainly under no illusion as to his own 
personal aspect, made public confession of an identical 
foible.&nbsp; Mr Henley may not have an equal affection for the 
looking-glass, but he is a very poor and unimaginative reader who
does not see him gloating over the god-like proportions of the 
shadow he sends sprawling over his own page.&nbsp; I make free to
say that a more self-conscious person than Mr Henley does not 
live.&nbsp; &lsquo;The best and most interesting part of 
Stevenson&rsquo;s life will never get written&mdash;even by 
me,&rsquo; says Mr Henley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one curious little mark of animus, or one 
equally curious affectation&mdash;I do not profess to know which,
and it is most probably a compound of the two&mdash;in Mr 
Henley&rsquo;s guardedly spiteful essay which asks for 
notice.&nbsp; The dead novelist signed his second name on his 
title-pages and his private correspondence 
&lsquo;Louis.&rsquo;&nbsp; Mr Henley spells it 
&lsquo;Lewis.&rsquo;&nbsp; Is this intended to say that Stevenson
took an ornamenting liberty with his own baptismal 
appellation?&nbsp; If so, why not say the thing and have done 
with it?&nbsp; Or is it one of Mr Henley&rsquo;s wilful 
ridiculosities?&nbsp; It seems to stand for some sort of meaning,
and to me, at least, it offers a jarring hint of small 
spitefulness which might go for nothing if it were not so well 
borne out by the general tone of Mr Henley&rsquo;s article.&nbsp;
It is a small matter enough, God knows, but it is precisely 
because it is so very small that it irritates.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI&mdash;HERO-VILLAINS</h2>
<p>In truth, it must indeed be here repeated that Stevenson for 
the reason he himself gave about <i>Deacon Brodie</i> utterly 
fails in that healthy hatred of &ldquo;fools and 
scoundrels&rdquo; on which Carlyle somewhat incontinently 
dilated.&nbsp; Nor does he, as we have seen, draw the line 
between hero and villain of the piece, as he ought to have done; 
and, even for his own artistic purposes, has it too much all on 
one side, to express it simply.&nbsp; Art demands relief from any
one phase of human nature, more especially of that phase, and 
even from what is morbid or exceptional.&nbsp; Admitting that 
such natures, say as Huish, the cockney, in the <i>Ebb-Tide</i> 
on the one side, and Prince Otto on the other are possible, it is
yet absolutely demanded that they should not stand <i>alone</i>, 
but have their due complement and balance present in the piece 
also to deter and finally to tell on them in the action.&nbsp; If
&ldquo;a knave or villain,&rdquo; as George Eliot aptly said, is 
but a fool with a circumbendibus, this not only wants to be 
shown, but to have that definite human counterpart and 
corrective; and this not in any indirect and perfunctory way, but
in a direct and effective sense.&nbsp; It is here that Stevenson 
fails&mdash;fails absolutely in most of his work, save the very 
latest&mdash;fails, as has been shown, in <i>The Master of 
Ballantrae</i>, as it were almost of perverse and set purpose, in
lack of what one might call ethical decision which causes him to 
waver or seem to waver and wobble in his judgment of his 
characters or in his sympathy with them or for them.&nbsp; Thus 
he fails to give his readers the proper cue which was his duty 
both as man and artist to have given.&nbsp; The highest art and 
the lowest are indeed here at one in demanding moral poise, if we
may call it so, that however crudely in the low, and however 
artistically and refinedly in the high, vice should not only not 
be set forth as absolutely triumphing, nor virtue as being 
absolutely, outwardly, and inwardly defeated.&nbsp; It is here 
the same in the melodrama of the transpontine theatre as in the 
tragedies of the Greek dramatists and Shakespeare.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;The evening brings a&rsquo; &lsquo;hame&rsquo;&rdquo; and 
the end ought to show something to satisfy the innate craving 
(for it is innate, thank Heaven! and low and high alike in 
moments of <i>elevated impression</i>, acknowledge it and bow to 
it) else there can scarce be true <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> and 
the sense of any moral rectitude or law remain as felt or 
acknowledged in human nature or in the Universe itself.</p>
<p>Stevenson&rsquo;s toleration and constant sermonising in the 
essays&mdash;his desire to make us yield allowances all round is 
so far, it may be, there in place; but it will not work out in 
story or play, and declares the need for correction and 
limitation the moment that he essays artistic 
presentation&mdash;from the point of view of art he lacks at once
artistic clearness and decision, and from the point of view of 
morality seems utterly loose and confusing.&nbsp; His artistic 
quality here rests wholly in his style&mdash;mere style, and he 
is, alas! a castaway as regards discernment and reading of human 
nature in its deepest demands and laws.&nbsp; Herein lies the 
false strain that has spoiled much of his earlier work, which 
renders really superficial and confusing and undramatic his 
professedly dramatic work&mdash;which never will and never can 
commend the hearty suffrages of a mixed and various theatrical 
audience in violating the very first rule of the theatre, and of 
dramatic creation.</p>
<p>From another point of view this is my answer to Mr Pinero in 
regard to the failure of Stevenson to command theatrical 
success.&nbsp; He confuses and so far misdirects the sympathies 
in issues which strictly are at once moral and dramatic.</p>
<p>I am absolutely at one with Mr Baildon, though I reach my 
results from somewhat different grounds from what he does, when 
he says this about <i>Beau Austin</i>, and the reason of its 
failure&mdash;complete failure&mdash;on the stage:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I confess I should have liked immensely to 
have seen [? to see] this piece on the boards; for only then 
could one be quite sure whether it could be made convincing to an
audience and carry their sympathies in the way the author 
intended.&nbsp; Yet the fact that <i>Beau Austin</i>, in spite of
being &lsquo;put on&rsquo; by so eminent an actor-manager as Mr 
Beerbohm Tree, was no great success on the stage, is a fair proof
that the piece lacked some of the essentials, good or bad, of 
dramatic success.&nbsp; Now a drama, like a picture or a musical 
composition, must have a certain unity of key and tone.&nbsp; You
can, indeed, mingle comedy with tragedy as an interlude or relief
from the strain and stress of the serious interest of the 
piece.&nbsp; But you cannot reverse the process and mingle 
tragedy with comedy.&nbsp; Once touch the fine spun-silk of the 
pretty fire-balloon of comedy with the tragic dagger, and it 
falls to earth a shrivelled nothing.&nbsp; And the reason that no
melodrama can be great art is just that it is a compromise 
between tragedy and comedy, a mixture of tragedy with comedy and 
not comedy with tragedy.&nbsp; So in drama, the middle course, 
proverbially the safest, is in reality the most dangerous.&nbsp; 
Now I maintain that in <i>Beau Austin</i> we have an element of 
tragedy.&nbsp; The betrayal of a beautiful, pure and noble-minded
woman is surely at once the basest act a man can be capable of, 
and a more tragic event than death itself to the woman.&nbsp; 
Richardson, in <i>Clarissa Harlowe</i>, is well aware of this, 
and is perfectly right in making his <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> 
tragic.&nbsp; Stevenson, on the other hand, patches up the matter
into a rather tame comedy.&nbsp; It is even much tamer than it 
would have been in the case of Lovelace and Clarissa Harlowe; for
Lovelace is a strong character, a man who could have been put 
through some crucial atonement, and come out purged and 
ennobled.&nbsp; But Beau Austin we feel is but a frip.&nbsp; He 
endures a few minutes of sharp humiliation, it is true, but to 
the spectator this cannot but seem a very insufficient expiation,
not only of the wrong he had done one woman, but of the 
indefinite number of wrongs he had done others.&nbsp; He is at 
once the villain and the hero of the piece, and in the narrow 
limits of a brief comedy this transformation cannot be 
convincingly effected.&nbsp; Wrongly or rightly, a theatrical 
audience, like the spectators of a trial, demand a definite 
verdict and sentence, and no play can satisfy which does not 
reasonably meet this demand.&nbsp; And this arises not from any 
merely Christian prudery or Puritanism, for it is as true for 
Greek tragedy and other high forms of dramatic art.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The transformation of villain into hero, if possible at all, 
could only be convincingly effected in a piece of wide scope, 
where there was room for working out the effect of some great 
shock, upheaval of the nature, change due to deep and 
unprecedented experiences&mdash;religious conversion, witnessing 
of sudden death, providential rescue from great peril of death, 
or circumstance of that kind; but to be effective and convincing 
it needs to be marked and <i>fully justified</i> in some such 
way; and no cleverness in the writer will absolve him from 
deference to this great law in serious work for presentation on 
the stage; if mere farces or little comedies may seem sometimes 
to contravene it, yet this&mdash;even this&mdash;is only in 
appearance.</p>
<p>True, it is not the dramatists part <i>of himself</i> to 
condemn, or to approve, or praise: he has to present, and to 
present various characters faithfully in their relation to each 
other, and their effect upon each other.&nbsp; But the moral 
element cannot be expunged or set lightly aside because it is 
closely involved in the very working out and presentation of 
these relations, and the effect upon each other.&nbsp; Character 
is vital.&nbsp; And character, if it tells in life, in influence 
and affection, must be made to tell directly also in the 
drama.&nbsp; There is no escape from this&mdash;none; the 
dramatist is lopsided if he tries to ignore it; he is a monster 
if he is wholly blind to it&mdash;like the poet in <i>In 
Memoriam</i>, &ldquo;Without a conscience or an aim.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr Henley, in his notorious, all too confessional, and yet rather
affected article on Stevenson in the <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>, 
has a remark which I confess astonished me&mdash;a remark I could
never forget as coming from him.&nbsp; He said that he &ldquo;had
lived a very full and varied life, and had no interest in remarks
about morals.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Remarks about morals&rdquo; 
are, nevertheless, in essence, the pith of all the books to which
he referred, as those to which he turned in preference to the 
<i>Edinburgh Edition</i> of R. L. Stevenson&rsquo;s works.&nbsp; 
The moral element is implicit in the drama, and it is implicit 
there because it is implicit in life itself, or so the great 
common-sense conceives it and demands it.&nbsp; What we might 
call the asides proper of the drama, are &ldquo;remarks about 
morals,&rdquo; nothing else&mdash;the chorus in the Greek tragedy
gathered up &ldquo;remarks about morals&rdquo; as near as might 
be to the &ldquo;remarks about morals&rdquo; in the streets of 
that day, only shaped to a certain artistic consistency.&nbsp; 
Shakespeare is rich in &ldquo;remarks about morals,&rdquo; often 
coming near, indeed, to personal utterance, and this not only 
when Polonius addresses his son before his going forth on his 
travels.&nbsp; Mr Henley here only too plainly confessed, indeed,
to lack of that conviction and insight which, had he but 
possessed them, might have done a little to relieve <i>Beau 
Austin</i> and the other plays in which he collaborated with R. 
L. Stevenson, from their besetting and fatal weakness.&nbsp; The 
two youths, alas! thought they could be grandly original by 
despising, or worse, contemning &ldquo;remarks about 
morals&rdquo; in the loftier as in the lower sense.&nbsp; To 
&ldquo;live a full and varied life,&rdquo; if the experience 
derived from it is to have expression in the drama, is only to 
have the richer resource in &ldquo;remarks about 
morals.&rdquo;&nbsp; If this is perverted under any 
self-conscious notion of doing something spick-and-span new in 
the way of character and plot, alien to all the old conceptions, 
then we know our writers set themselves boldly at loggerheads 
with certain old-fashioned and yet older new-fashioned laws, 
which forbid the violation of certain common demands of the 
ordinary nature and common-sense; and for the lack of this, as 
said already, no cleverness, no resource, no style or graft, will
any way make up.&nbsp; So long as this is tried, with whatever 
concentration of mind and purpose, failure is yet inevitable, and
the more inevitable the more concentration and less of humorous 
by-play, because genius itself, if it despises the general moral 
sentiment and instinct for moral proportion&mdash;an ethnic 
reward and punishment, so to say&mdash;is all astray, working 
outside the line; and this, if Mr Pinero will kindly excuse me, 
is the secret of the failure of these plays, and not want of 
concentration, etc., in the sense he meant, or as he has put 
it.</p>
<p>Stevenson rather affected what he called &ldquo;tail-foremost 
morality,&rdquo; a kind of inversion in the field of morals, as 
De Quincey mixed it up with tail-foremost humour in <i>Murder as 
a Fine Art</i>, etc., etc., but for all such perversions as these
the stage is a grand test and corrector, and such perversions, 
and not &ldquo;remarks about morals,&rdquo; are most strictly 
prohibited there.&nbsp; Perverted subtleties of the sort 
Stevenson in earlier times especially much affected are not only 
amiss but ruinous on the stage; and what genius itself would 
maybe sanction, common-sense must reject and rigidly cut 
away.&nbsp; Final success and triumph come largely by <i>this</i>
kind of condensation and concentration, and the stern and severe 
lopping off of the indulgence of the <i>egotistical</i> genius, 
which is human discipline, and the best exponent of the doctrine 
of unity also.&nbsp; This is the straight and the narrow way 
along which genius, if it walk but faithfully, sows as it goes in
the dramatic pathway all the flowers of human passion, hope, 
love, terror, and triumph.</p>
<p>I find it advisable, if not needful, here to reinforce my own 
impressions, at some points, by another quotation from Mr 
Baildon, if he will allow me, in which Stevenson&rsquo;s 
dependence in certain respects on the dream-faculty is 
emphasised, and to it is traced a certain tendency to a moral 
callousness or indifference which is one of the things in which 
the waking Stevenson transparently suffered now and then 
invasions from the dream-Stevenson&mdash;the result, a kind of 
spot, as we may call it, on the eye of the moral sense; it is a 
small spot; but we know how a very small object held close before
the eye will wholly shut out the most lovely natural prospects, 
interposing distressful phantasmagoria, due to the strained and, 
for the time, morbid condition of the organ itself.&nbsp; So, it 
must be confessed, it is to a great extent here.</p>
<p>But listen to Mr Baildon:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In <i>A Chapter on Dreams</i>, Stevenson confesses his 
indebtedness to this still mysterious agency.&nbsp; From a child 
he had been a great and vivid dreamer, his dreams often taking 
such frightful shape that he used to awake &lsquo;clinging in 
terror to the bedpost.&rsquo;&nbsp; Later in life his dreams 
continued to be frequent and vivid, but less terrifying in 
character and more continuous and systematic.&nbsp; &lsquo;The 
Brownies,&rsquo; as he picturesquely names that 
&lsquo;sub-conscious imagination,&rsquo; as the scientist would 
call it, that works with such surprising freedom and ingenuity in
our dreams, became, as it were, <i>collaborateurs</i> in his work
of authorship.&nbsp; He declares that they invented plots and 
even elaborated whole novels, and that, not in a single night or 
single dream, but continuously, and from one night to another, 
like a story in serial parts.&nbsp; Long before this essay was 
written or published, I had been struck by this phantasmal 
dream-like quality in some of Stevenson&rsquo;s works, which I 
was puzzled to account for, until I read this extraordinary 
explanation, for explanation it undoubtedly affords.&nbsp; 
Anything imagined in a dream would have a tendency, when retold, 
to retain something of its dream-like character, and I have on 
doubt one could trace in many instances and distinguish the 
dreaming and the waking Stevenson, though in others they may be 
blended beyond recognition.&nbsp; The trouble with the Brownies 
or the dream-Stevenson <i>was his or their want of moral 
sense</i>, so that they sometimes presented the waking author 
with plots which he could not make use of.&nbsp; Of this 
Stevenson gives an instance in which a complete story of marked 
ingenuity is vetoed through the moral impossibility of its 
presentment by a writer so scrupulous (and in some directions he 
is extremely scrupulous) as Stevenson was.&nbsp; But Stevenson 
admits that his most famous story, <i>The Strange Case of Dr 
Jekyll and Mr Hyde</i>, was not only suggested by a dream, but 
that some of the most important and most criticised points, such 
as the matter of the powder, were taken direct from the 
dream.&nbsp; It had been extremely instructive and interesting 
had he gone more into detail and mentioned some of the other 
stories into which the dream-element entered largely and pointed 
out its influence, and would have given us a better clue than we 
have or now ever can have.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even in <i>The Suicide Club</i> and the 
<i>Rajah&rsquo;s Diamond</i>, I seem to feel strongly the 
presence of the dream-Stevenson. . . . <i>At certain points one 
feels conscious of a certain moral callousness</i>, <i>such as 
marks the dream state</i>, <i>as in the murder of Colonel 
Geraldine&rsquo;s brother</i>, <i>the horror of which never seems
to come fully home to us</i>.&nbsp; But let no one suppose these 
stories are lacking in vividness and in strangely realistic 
detail; for this is of the very nature of dreaming at its height.
. . . While the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> play their parts 
with the utmost spirit while the story proceeds, they do not, as 
the past creations do, seem to survive this first contact and 
live in our minds.&nbsp; This is particularly true of the 
women.&nbsp; They are well drawn, and play the assigned parts 
well enough, but they do not, as a rule, make a place for 
themselves either in our hearts or memories.&nbsp; If there is an
exception it is Elvira, in <i>Providence and the Guitar</i>; but 
we remember her chiefly by the one picture of her falling asleep,
after the misadventures of the night, at the supper-table, with 
her head on her husband&rsquo;s shoulder, and her hand locked in 
his with instinctive, almost unconscious tenderness.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII&mdash;MR G. MOORE, MR MARRIOTT WATSON AND 
OTHERS</h2>
<p>From our point of view it will therefore be seen that we could
not have read Mr George Moore&rsquo;s wonderfully uncritical and 
misdirected diatribe against Stevenson in <i>The Daily 
Chronicle</i> of 24th April 1897, without amusement, if not 
without laughter&mdash;indeed, we confess we may here quote 
Shakespeare&rsquo;s words, we &ldquo;laughed so consumedly&rdquo;
that, unless for Mr Moore&rsquo;s high position and his assured 
self-confidence, we should not trust ourselves to refer to it, 
not to speak of writing about it.&nbsp; It was a review of <i>The
Secret Rose</i> by W. B. Yeats, but it passed after one single 
touch to belittling abuse of Stevenson&mdash;an abuse that was 
justified the more, in Mr Moore&rsquo;s idea, because Stevenson 
was dead.&nbsp; Had he been alive he might have had something to 
say to it, in the way, at least, of fable and moral.&nbsp; And 
when towards the close Mr Moore again quotes from Mr Yeats, it is
still &ldquo;harping on my daughter&rdquo; to undo Stevenson, as 
though a rat was behind the arras, as in <i>Hamlet</i>.&nbsp; 
&ldquo;Stevenson,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;is the leader of these 
countless writers who perceive nothing but the visible 
world,&rdquo; and these are antagonistic to the great literature,
of which Mr Yeats&rsquo;s <i>Secret Rose</i> is a survival or a 
renaissance, a literature whose watchword should be Mr 
Yeats&rsquo;s significant phrase, &ldquo;When one looks into the 
darkness there is always something there.&rdquo;&nbsp; No doubt 
Mr Yeats&rsquo;s product all along the line ranks with the great 
literature&mdash;unlike Homer, according to Mr Moore, he never 
nods, though in the light of great literature, poor Stevenson is 
always at his noddings, and more than that, in the words of 
Leland&rsquo;s Hans Breitmann, he has &ldquo;nodings 
on.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is poor, naked, miserable&mdash;a mere 
pretender&mdash;and has no share in the makings of great 
literature.&nbsp; Mr Moore has stripped him to the skin, and 
leaves him to the mercy of rain and storm, like Lear, though Lear
had a solid ground to go on in self-aid, which Stevenson had not;
he had daughters, and one of them was Cordelia, after all.&nbsp; 
This comes of painting all boldly in black and white: Mr Yeats is
white, R. L. Stevenson is black, and I am sure neither one nor 
other, because simply of their self-devotion to their art, could 
have subscribed heartily to Mr Moore&rsquo;s black art and white 
art theory.&nbsp; Mr Yeats is hardly the truest modern Celtic 
artist I take him for, if he can fully subscribe to all this.</p>
<p>Mr Marriott Watson has a little unadvisedly, in my view, too 
like ambition, fallen on &rsquo;tother side, and celebrated 
Stevenson as the master of the horrifying. <a 
name="citation11"></a><a href="#footnote11" 
class="citation">[11]</a>&nbsp; He even finds the 
<i>Ebb-Tide</i>, and Huish, the cockney, in it richly 
illustrative and grand.&nbsp; &ldquo;There never was a more 
magnificent cad in literature, and never a more foul-hearted 
little ruffian.&nbsp; His picture glitters (!) with life, and 
when he curls up on the island beach with the bullet in his body,
amid the flames of the vitriol he had intended for another, the 
reader&rsquo;s shudder conveys something also, even (!) of 
regret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And well it may!&nbsp; Individual taste and opinion are but 
individual taste and opinion, but the <i>Ebb-Tide</i> and the 
cockney I should be inclined to cite as a specimen of 
Stevenson&rsquo;s all too facile make-believe, in which there is 
too definite a machinery set agoing for horrors for the horrors 
to be quite genuine.&nbsp; The process is often too forced with 
Stevenson, and the incidents too much of the manufactured order, 
for the triumph of that simplicity which is of inspiration and 
unassailable.&nbsp; Here Stevenson, alas! all too often, 
<i>pace</i> Mr Marriott Watson, treads on the skirts of E. A. 
Poe, and that in his least composed and elevated artistic 
moments.&nbsp; And though, it is true, that &ldquo;genius will 
not follow rules laid down by desultory critics,&rdquo; yet when 
it is averred that &ldquo;this piece of work fulfils 
Aristotle&rsquo;s definition of true tragedy, in accomplishing 
upon the reader a certain purification of the emotions by means 
of terror and pity,&rdquo; expectations will be raised in many of
the new generation, doomed in the cases of the more sensitive and
discerning, at all events, not to be gratified.&nbsp; There is a 
distinction, very bold and very essential, between melodrama, 
however carefully worked and staged, and that tragedy to which 
Aristotle was there referring.&nbsp; Stevenson&rsquo;s 
&ldquo;horrifying,&rdquo; to my mind, too often touches the 
trying borders of melodrama, and nowhere more so than in the very
forced and unequal <i>Ebb-Tide</i>, which, with its rather 
doubtful moral and forced incident when it is good, seems merely 
to borrow from what had gone before, if not a very little even 
from some of what came after.&nbsp; No service is done to an 
author like Stevenson by fatefully praising him for precisely the
wrong thing.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Romance attracted Stevenson, at least 
during the earlier part of his life, as a lodestone attracts the 
magnet.&nbsp; To romance he brought the highest gifts, and he has
left us not only essays of delicate humour&rdquo; (should this 
not be &ldquo;essays <i>full of</i>&rdquo; <i>or</i> 
&ldquo;characterised by&rdquo;?) &ldquo;and sensitive 
imagination, but stories also which thrill with the realities of 
life, which are faithful pictures of the times and tempers he 
dealt with, and which, I firmly believe, will live so&rdquo; 
(should it not be &ldquo;as&rdquo;?) &ldquo;long as our noble 
English language.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Marriott Watson sees very clearly in some things; but 
occasionally he misses the point.&nbsp; The problem is here 
raised how two honest, far-seeing critics could see so very 
differently on so simple a subject.</p>
<p>Mr Baildon says about the <i>Ebb-Tide</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I can compare his next book, the 
<i>Ebb-Tide</i> (in collaboration with Osbourne) to little better
than a mud-bath, for we find ourselves, as it were, unrelieved by
dredging among the scum and dregs of humanity, the &lsquo;white 
trash&rsquo; of the Pacific.&nbsp; Here we have Stevenson&rsquo;s
masterly but utterly revolting incarnation of the lowest, vilest,
vulgarest villainy in the cockney, Huish.&nbsp; Stevenson&rsquo;s
other villains shock us by their cruel and wicked conduct; but 
there is a kind of fallen satanic glory about them, some shining 
threads of possible virtue.&nbsp; They might have been good, even
great in goodness, but for the malady of not wanting.&nbsp; But 
Huish is a creature hatched in slime, his soul has no true 
humanity: it is squat and toad-like, and can only spit venom. . .
. He himself felt a sort of revulsive after-sickness for the 
story, and calls it in one passage of his <i>Vailima Letters</i> 
&lsquo;the ever-to-be-execrated <i>Ebb-Tide</i>&rsquo; (pp.&nbsp;
178 and 184). . . . He repented of it like a debauch, and, as 
with some men after a debauch, felt cleared and strengthened 
instead of wrecked.&nbsp; So, after what in one sense was his 
lowest plunge, Stevenson rose to the greatest height.&nbsp; That 
is the tribute to his virtue and strength indeed, but it does not
change the character of the <i>Ebb-Tide</i> as &lsquo;the 
ever-to-be-execrated.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Baildon truly says (p. 49):</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The curious point is that Stevenson&rsquo;s
own great fault, that tendency to what has been called the 
&lsquo;Twopence-coloured&rsquo; style, is always at its worst in 
books over which he collaborated.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Verax,&rdquo; in one of his &ldquo;Occasional 
Papers&rdquo; in the <i>Daily News</i> on &ldquo;The Average 
Reader&rdquo; has this passage:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;We should not object to a writer who could 
repeat Barrie in <i>A Window in Thrums</i>, nor to one who would 
paint a scene as Louis Stevenson paints Attwater alone on his 
South Sea island, the approach of the pirates to the harbour, and
their subsequent reception and fate.&nbsp; All these are surely 
specimens of brilliant writing, and they are brilliant because, 
in the first place, they give truth.&nbsp; The events described 
must, in the supposed circumstances, and with the given 
characters, have happened in the way stated.&nbsp; Only in none 
of the specimens have we a mere photograph of the outside of what
took place.&nbsp; We have great pictures by genius of 
the&mdash;to the prosaic eye&mdash;invisible realities, as well 
as of the outward form of the actions.&nbsp; We behold and are 
made to feel the solemnity, the wildness, the pathos, the 
earnestness, the agony, the pity, the moral squalor, the 
grotesque fun, the delicate and minute beauty, the natural 
loveliness and loneliness, the quiet desperate bravery, or 
whatever else any of these wonderful pictures disclose to our 
view.&nbsp; Had we been lookers-on, we, the average readers, 
could not have seen these qualities for ourselves.&nbsp; But they
are there, and genius enables us to see them.&nbsp; Genius makes 
truth shine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not, therefore, probable that the brilliancy 
which we average readers do not want, and only laugh at when we 
get it, is something altogether different?&nbsp; I think I know 
what it is.&nbsp; It is an attempt to describe with words without
thoughts, an effort to make readers see something the writer has 
never seen himself in his mind&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; He has no 
revelation, no vision, nothing to disclose, and to produce an 
impression uses words, words, words, makes daub, daub, daub, 
without any definite purpose, and certainly without any real, or 
artistic, or definite effect.&nbsp; To describe, one must first 
of all see, and if we see anything the description of it will, as
far as it is in us, come as effortless and natural as the leaves 
on trees, or as &lsquo;the tender greening of April 
meadows.&rsquo;&nbsp; I, therefore, more than suspect that the 
brilliancy which the average reader laughs at is not 
brilliancy.&nbsp; A pot of flaming red paint thrown at a canvas 
does not make a picture.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now there is vision for outward picture or separate incident, 
which may exist quite apart from what may be called moral, 
spiritual, or even loftily imaginative conception, at once 
commanding unity and commanding it.&nbsp; There can be no doubt 
of Stevenson&rsquo;s power in the former line&mdash;the earliest 
as the latest of his works are witnesses to it.&nbsp; <i>The 
Master of Ballantrae</i> abounds in picture and incident and 
dramatic situations and touches; but it lacks true unity, and the
reason simply is given by Stevenson himself&mdash;that the 
&ldquo;ending shames, perhaps degrades, the beginning,&rdquo; as 
it is in the <i>Ebb-Tide</i>, with the cockney Huish, 
&ldquo;execrable.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We have great pictures by 
genius of the&mdash;to the prosaic eye&mdash;invisible realities,
as well as the outward form of the action.&rdquo;&nbsp; True, but
the &ldquo;invisible realities&rdquo; form that from which true 
unity is derived, else their partial presence but makes the whole
the more incomplete and lop-sided, if not indeed, top-heavy, from
light weight beneath; and it is in the unity derived from this 
higher pervading, yet not too assertive &ldquo;invisible 
reality,&rdquo; that Stevenson most often fails, and is, in his 
own words, &ldquo;execrable&rdquo;; the ending shaming, if not 
degrading, the beginning&mdash;&ldquo;and without the true sense 
of pleasurableness; and therefore really imperfect <i>in 
essence</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah, it is to be feared that Stevenson, 
viewing it in retrospect, was a far truer critic of his own work,
than many or most of his all too effusive and admiring 
critics&mdash;from Lord Rosebery to Mr Marriott Watson.</p>
<p>Amid the too extreme deliverances of detractors and especially
of erewhile friends, become detractors or panegyrists, who 
disturb judgment by overzeal, which is often but half-blindness, 
it is pleasant to come on one who bears the balances in his hand,
and will report faithfully as he has seen and felt, neither more 
nor less than what he holds is true.&nbsp; Mr Andrew Lang wrote 
an article in the <i>Morning Post</i> of 16th December 1901, 
under the title &ldquo;Literary Quarrels,&rdquo; in which, as I 
think, he fulfilled his part in midst of the talk about Mr 
Henley&rsquo;s regrettable attack on Stevenson.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Without defending the character of a friend
whom even now I almost daily miss, as that character was 
displayed in circumstances unknown to me, I think that I ought to
speak of him as I found him.&nbsp; Perhaps our sympathy was 
mainly intellectual.&nbsp; Constantly do those who knew him 
desire to turn to him, to communicate with him, to share with him
the pleasure of some idea, some little discovery about men or 
things in which he would have taken pleasure, increasing our own 
by the gaiety of his enjoyment, the brilliance of his 
appreciation.&nbsp; We may say, as Scott said at the grave of 
John Ballantyne, that he has taken with him half the sunlight out
of our lives.&nbsp; That he was sympathetic and interested in the
work of others (which I understand has been denied) I have reason
to know.&nbsp; His work and mine lay far apart: mine, I think, we
never discussed, I did not expect it to interest him.&nbsp; But 
in a fragmentary manuscript of his after his death I found the 
unlooked for and touching evidence of his kindness.&nbsp; Again, 
he once wrote to me from Samoa about the work of a friend of mine
whom he had never met.&nbsp; His remarks were ideally judicious, 
a model of serviceable criticism.&nbsp; I found him chivalrous as
an honest boy; brave, with an indomitable gaiety of courage; on 
the point of honour, a Sydney or a Bayard (so he seemed to me); 
that he was open-handed I have reason to believe; he took life 
&lsquo;with a frolic welcome.&rsquo;&nbsp; That he was 
self-conscious, and saw himself as it were, from without; that he
was fond of attitude (like his own brave admirals) he himself 
knew well, and I doubt not that he would laugh at himself and his
habit of &lsquo;playing at&rsquo; things after the fashion of 
childhood.&nbsp; Genius is the survival into maturity of the 
inspiration of childhood, and Stevenson is not the only genius 
who has retained from childhood something more than its 
inspiration.&nbsp; Other examples readily occur to the 
memory&mdash;in one way Byron, in another Tennyson.&nbsp; None of
us is perfect: I do not want to erect an immaculate clay-cold 
image of a man, in marble or in sugar-candy.&nbsp; But I will say
that I do not remember ever to have heard Mr Stevenson utter a 
word against any mortal, friend or foe.&nbsp; Even in a case 
where he had, or believed himself to have, received some wrong, 
his comment was merely humorous.&nbsp; Especially when very 
young, his dislike of respectability and of the <i>bourgeois</i> 
(a literary tradition) led him to show a kind of contempt for 
virtues which, though certainly respectable, are no less 
certainly virtuous.&nbsp; He was then more or less seduced by the
Bohemian legend, but he was intolerant of the fudge about the 
rights and privileges of genius.&nbsp; A man&rsquo;s first 
business, he thought, was &lsquo;keep his end up&rsquo; by his 
work.&nbsp; If, what he reckoned his inspired work would not 
serve, then by something else.&nbsp; Of many virtues he was an 
ensample and an inspiring force.&nbsp; One foible I admit: the 
tendency to inopportune benevolence.&nbsp; Mr Graham Balfour says
that if he fell into ill terms with a man he would try to do him 
good by stealth.&nbsp; Though he had seen much of the world and 
of men, this practice showed an invincible ignorance of 
mankind.&nbsp; It is improbable, on the doctrine of chances, that
he was always in the wrong; and it is probable, as he was human, 
that he always thought himself in the right.&nbsp; But as the 
other party to the misunderstanding, being also human, would 
necessarily think himself in the right, such secret benefits 
would be, as Sophocles says, &lsquo;the gifts of foeman and 
unprofitable.&rsquo;&nbsp; The secret would leak out, the 
benefits would be rejected, the misunderstanding would be 
embittered.&nbsp; This reminds me of an anecdote which is not 
given in Mr Graham Balfour&rsquo;s biography.&nbsp; As a little 
delicate, lonely boy in Edinburgh, Mr Stevenson read a book 
called <i>Ministering Children</i>.&nbsp; I have a faint 
recollection of this work concerning a small Lord and Lady 
Bountiful.&nbsp; Children, we know, like to &lsquo;play at&rsquo;
the events and characters they have read about, and the boy 
wanted to play at being a ministering child.&nbsp; He 
&lsquo;scanned his whole horizon&rsquo; for somebody to play 
with, and thought he had found his playmate.&nbsp; From the 
window he observed street boys (in Scots &lsquo;keelies&rsquo;) 
enjoying themselves.&nbsp; But one child was out of the sports, a
little lame fellow, the son of a baker.&nbsp; Here was a 
chance!&nbsp; After some misgivings Louis hardened his heart, put
on his cap, walked out&mdash;a refined little 
figure&mdash;approached the object of his sympathy, and said, 
&lsquo;Will you let me play with you?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Go to 
hell!&rsquo; said the democratic offspring of the baker.&nbsp; 
This lesson against doing good by stealth to persons of unknown 
or hostile disposition was, it seems, thrown away.&nbsp; Such 
endeavours are apt to be misconstrued.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII&mdash;UNEXPECTED COMBINATIONS</h2>
<p>The complete artist should not be mystical-moralist any more 
than the man who &ldquo;perceives only the visible 
world&rdquo;&mdash;he should not engage himself with problems in 
the direct sense any more than he should blind himself to their 
effect upon others, whom he should study, and under certain 
conditions represent, though he should not commit himself to any 
form of zealot faith, yet should he not be, as Lord Tennyson puts
it in the Palace of Art:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;As God holding no form of creed,<br />
But contemplating all,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>because his power lies in the broadness of his humanity 
touched to fine issues whenever there is the seal at once of 
truth, reality, and passion, and the tragedy bred of their 
contact and conflict.</p>
<p>All these things are to him real and clamant in the measure 
that they aid appeal to heart and emotion&mdash;in the measure 
that they may, in his hands, be made to tell for sympathy and 
general effect.&nbsp; He creates an atmosphere in which each and 
all may be seen the more effectively, but never seen alone or 
separate, but only in strict relation to each other that they may
heighten the sense of some supreme controlling power in the 
destinies of men, which with the ancients was figured as Fate, 
and for which the moderns have hardly yet found an enduring and 
exhaustive name.&nbsp; Character revealed in reference to that, 
is the ideal and the aim of all high creative art.&nbsp; 
Stevenson&rsquo;s narrowness, allied to a quaint and occasionally
just a wee pedantic finickiness, as we may call it&mdash;an 
over-elaborate, almost tricky play with mere words and phrases, 
was in so far alien to the very highest&mdash;he was too often 
like a man magnetised and moving at the dictates of some outside 
influence rather than according to his own freewill and as he 
would.</p>
<p>Action in creative literary art is a <i>sine qu&acirc; 
non</i>; keeping all the characters and parts in unison, that a 
true <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>, determined by their own tendencies
and temperaments, may appear; dialogue and all asides, if we may 
call them so, being supererogatory and weak really unless they 
aid this and are constantly contributory to it.&nbsp; Egotistical
predeterminations, however artfully intruded, are, alien to the 
full result, the unity which is finally craved: Stevenson fails, 
when he does fail, distinctly from excess of egotistic regards; 
he is, as Henley has said, in the French sense, too 
<i>personnel</i>, and cannot escape from it.&nbsp; And though 
these personal regards are exceedingly interesting and indeed 
fascinating from the point of view of autobiographical study, 
they are, and cannot but be, a drawback on fiction or the 
disinterested revelation of life and reality.&nbsp; Instead, 
therefore, of &ldquo;the visible world,&rdquo; as the only thing 
seen, Stevenson&rsquo;s defect is, that between it and him lies a
cloud strictly self-projected, like breath on a mirror, which 
dims the lines of reality and confuses the character marks, in 
fact melting them into each other; and in his sympathetic 
regards, causing them all to become too much alike.&nbsp; Scott 
had more of the power of healthy self-withdrawal, creating more 
of a free atmosphere, in which his characters could freely 
move&mdash;though in this, it must be confessed, he failed far 
more with women than with men.&nbsp; The very defects poor 
Carlyle found in Scott, and for which he dealt so severely with 
him, as sounding no depth, are really the basis of his strength, 
precisely as the absence of them were the defects of Goethe, who 
invariably ran his characters finally into the mere moods of his 
own mind and the mould of his errant philosophy, so that they 
became merely erratic symbols without hold in the common 
sympathy.&nbsp; Whether <i>Walverwandschaften</i>, <i>Wilhelm 
Meister</i>, or <i>Faust</i>, it is still the same&mdash;the 
company before all is done are translated into misty shapes that 
he actually needs to label for our identification and for his 
own.&nbsp; Even Mr G. H. Lewes saw this and could not help 
declaring his own lack of interest in the latter parts of 
Goethe&rsquo;s greatest efforts.&nbsp; Stevenson, too, tends to 
run his characters into symbols&mdash;his moralist-fabulist 
determinations are too much for him&mdash;he would translate them
into a kind of chessmen, moved or moving on a board.&nbsp; The 
essence of romance strictly is, that as the characters will not 
submit themselves to the check of reality, the romancer may 
consciously, if it suits him, touch them at any point with the 
magic wand of symbol, and if he finds a consistency in mere 
fanciful invention it is enough.&nbsp; Tieck&rsquo;s 
<i>Phantasus</i> and George MacDonald&rsquo;s <i>Phantastes</i> 
are ready instances illustrative of this.&nbsp; But it is very 
different with the story of real life, where there is a definite 
check in the common-sense and knowledge of the reader, and where 
the highest victory always lies in drawing from the reader the 
admission&mdash;&ldquo;that is life&mdash;life exactly as I have 
seen and known it.&nbsp; Though I could never have put it so, 
still it only realises my own conception and observation.&nbsp; 
That is something lovingly remembered and re-presented, and this 
master makes me lovingly remember too, though &rsquo;twas his to 
represent and reproduce with such vigor, vividness and truth that
he carried me with him, exactly as though I had been looking on 
real men and women playing their part or their game in the great 
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Zangwill, in his own style, wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;He seeks to combine the novel of character 
with the novel of adventure; to develop character through 
romantic action, and to bring out your hero at the end of the 
episode, not the fixed character he was at the beginning, as is 
the way of adventure books, but a modified creature. . . . It is 
his essays and his personality, rather than his novels, that will
count with posterity.&nbsp; On the whole, a great provincial 
writer.&nbsp; Whether he has that inherent grip which makes a 
man&rsquo;s provinciality the very source of his strength . . . 
only the centuries can show.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The romanticist to the end pursued Stevenson&mdash;he could 
not, wholly or at once, shake off the bonds in which he had bound
himself to his first love, and it was the romanticist crossed by 
the casuist, and the mystic&mdash;Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, Markheim
and Will of the Mill, insisted on his acknowledging them in his 
work up to the end.&nbsp; <i>The modified creature</i> at the end
of Mr Zangwill was modified too directly by the egotistic element
as well as through the romantic action, and this point missed the
great defect was missed, and Mr Zangwill spoke only in 
generals.</p>
<p>M. Schwob, after having related how unreal a real 
sheep&rsquo;s heart looked when introduced on the end of 
Giovanni&rsquo;s dagger in a French performance of John 
Ford&rsquo;s <i>Annabella and Giovanni</i>, and how at the next 
performance the audience was duly thrilled when Annabella&rsquo;s
bleeding heart, made of a bit of red flannel, was borne upon the 
stage, goes on to say significantly:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Il me semble que les personnages de 
Stevenson ont justement cette esp&egrave;ce de r&eacute;alisme 
irr&eacute;al.&nbsp; La large figure luisante de Long John, la 
couleur bl&ecirc;me du cr&acirc;ne de Thevenin Pensete 
s&rsquo;attachent &agrave; la m&eacute;moire de nos yeux en 
vertue de leur irr&eacute;alit&eacute; m&ecirc;me.&nbsp; Ce sont 
des fant&ocirc;mes de la v&eacute;rit&eacute;, hallucinants comme
de vrais fant&ocirc;mes.&nbsp; Notez en passant que les traits de
John Silver hallucinent Jim Hawkins, et que Fran&ccedil;ois 
Villon est hant&eacute; par l&rsquo;aspect de Thevenin 
Pensete.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the most notable fact arising here, and one that well 
deserves celebration, is this, that Stevenson&rsquo;s development
towards a broader and more natural creation was coincident with a
definite return on the religious views which had so powerfully 
prevailed with his father&mdash;a circumstance which it is to be 
feared did not, any more than some other changes in him, at all 
commend itself to Mr Henley, though he had deliberately dubbed 
him even in the times of nursing nigh to the Old Bristo Port in 
Edinburgh&mdash;something of &ldquo;Shorter Catechist.&rdquo; 
Anyway Miss Simpson deliberately wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Mr Henley takes exception to 
Stevenson&rsquo;s later phase in life&mdash;what he calls his 
&lsquo;Shorter Catechism phase.&rsquo;&nbsp; It should be 
remembered that Mr Henley is not a Scotsman, and in some things 
has little sympathy with Scotch characteristics.&nbsp; Stevenson,
in his Samoan days, harked back to the teaching of his youth; the
tenets of the Shorter Catechism, which his mother and nurse had 
dinned into his head, were not forgotten.&nbsp; Mr Henley knew 
him best, as Stevenson says in the preface to <i>Virginibus 
Puerisque</i> dedicated to Henley, &lsquo;when he lived his life 
at twenty-five.&rsquo;&nbsp; In these days he had [in some 
degree] forgotten about the Shorter Catechism, but the 
&lsquo;solemn pause&rsquo; between Saturday and Monday came back 
in full force to R. L. Stevenson in Samoa.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now to me that is a most suggestive and significant 
fact.&nbsp; It will be the business of future critics to show in 
how far such falling back would of necessity modify what Mr 
Baildon has set down as his corner-stone of morality, and how far
it was bound to modify the atmosphere&mdash;the purely egotistic,
hedonistic, and artistic atmosphere, in which, in his earlier 
life as a novelist, at all events, he had been, on the whole, for
long whiles content to work.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIX&mdash;LOVE OF VAGABONDS</h2>
<p>What is very remarkable in Stevenson is that a man who was so 
much the dreamer of dreams&mdash;the mystic moralist, the 
constant questioner and speculator on human destiny and human 
perversity, and the riddles that arise on the search for the 
threads of motive and incentives to human action&mdash;moreover, 
a man, who constantly suffered from one of the most trying and 
weakening forms of ill-health&mdash;should have been so 
full-blooded, as it were, so keen for contact with all forms of 
human life and character, what is called the rougher and coarser 
being by no means excluded.&nbsp; Not only this: he was himself a
rover&mdash;seeking daily adventure and contact with men and 
women of alien habit and taste and liking.&nbsp; His patience is 
supported by his humour.&nbsp; He was a bit of a vagabond in the 
good sense of the word, and always going round in search of 
&ldquo;honest men,&rdquo; like Diogenes, and with no tub to 
retire into or the desire for it.&nbsp; He thus on this side 
touches the Chaucers and their kindred, as well as the Spensers 
and Dantes and their often illusive 
<i>confr&egrave;res</i>.&nbsp; His voyage as a steerage passenger
across the Atlantic is only one out of a whole chapter of such 
episodes, and is more significant and characteristic even than 
the <i>Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes</i> or the <i>Inland
Voyage</i>.&nbsp; These might be ranked with the 
&ldquo;Sentimental Journeys&rdquo; that have sometimes been the 
fashion&mdash;that was truly of a prosaic and risky order.&nbsp; 
The appeal thus made to an element deep in the English nature 
will do much to keep his memory green in the hearts that could 
not rise to appreciation of his style and literary gifts at 
all.&nbsp; He loves the roadways and the by-ways, and those to be
met with there&mdash;like him in this, though unlike him in most 
else.&nbsp; The love of the roadsides and the greenwood&mdash;and
the queer miscellany of life there unfolded and ever 
changing&mdash;a kind of gipsy-like longing for the tent and 
familiar contact with nature and rude human-nature in the open 
dates from beyond Chaucer, and remains and will have 
gratification&mdash;the longing for novelty and all the 
accidents, as it were, of pilgrimage and rude social 
travel.&nbsp; You see it bubble up, like a true and new 
nature-spring, through all the surface coatings of culture and 
artificiality, in Stevenson.&nbsp; He anew, without pretence, 
enlivens it&mdash;makes it first a part of himself, and then a 
part of literature once more.&nbsp; Listen to him, as he 
sincerely sings this passion for the pilgrimage&mdash;or the 
modern phase of it&mdash;innocent vagabond roving:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Give to me the life I love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the lave go by me;<br />
Give the jolly heaven above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the by-way nigh me:<br />
Bed in the bush, with stars to see;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bread I dip in the river&mdash;<br />
Here&rsquo;s the life for a man like me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s the life for ever. . . .</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the blow fall soon or late;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Let what will be o&rsquo;er me;<br />
Give the face of earth around<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the road before me.<br />
Health I ask not, hope nor love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor a friend to know me:<br />
All I ask the heaven above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the road below me.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True; this is put in the mouth of another, but Stevenson could
not have so voiced it, had he not been the born rover that he 
was, with longing for the roadside, the high hills, and forests 
and newcomers and varied miscellaneous company.&nbsp; Here he 
does more directly speak in his own person and quite to the same 
effect:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I will make you brooches and toys for your 
delight<br />
Of bird song at morning, and star shine at night,<br />
I will make a palace fit for you and me,<br />
Of green days in forests and blue days at sea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make my kitchen, and you shall keep your 
room,<br />
Where white flows the river, and bright blows the broom,<br />
And you shall wash your linen and keep your body white,<br />
In rainfall at morning and dew-fall at night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this shall be for music when no one else is 
near,<br />
The fine song for singing, the rare song to hear!<br />
That only I remember, that only you admire,<br />
Of the broad road that stretches, and the roadside 
fire.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Stevenson, though original in his vein and way, but 
follows a great and gracious company in which Fielding and Sterne
and so many others stand as pleasant proctors.&nbsp; Scott and 
Dickens have each in their way essayed it, and made much of it 
beyond what mere sentiment would have reached.&nbsp; 
<i>Pickwick</i> itself&mdash;and we must always regard Dickens as
having himself gone already over every bit of road, described 
every nook and corner, and tried every resource&mdash;is a 
vagrant fellow, in a group of erratic and most quaint wanderers 
or pilgrims.&nbsp; This is but a return phase of it; Vincent 
Crummles and Mrs Crummles and the &ldquo;Infant 
Phenomenon,&rdquo; yet another.&nbsp; The whole interest lies in 
the roadways, and the little inns, and the odd and unexpected 
<i>rencontres</i> with oddly-assorted fellows there experienced: 
glimpses of grim or grimy, or forbidding, or happy, smiling 
smirking vagrants, and out-at-elbows fellow-passengers and 
guests, with jests and quips and cranks, and hanky-panky 
even.&nbsp; On high roads and in inns, and alehouses, with 
travelling players, rogues and tramps, Dickens was quite at home;
and what is yet more, he made us all quite at home with them: and
he did it as Chaucer did it by thorough good spirits and 
&ldquo;hail-fellow-well-met.&rdquo;&nbsp; And, with all his 
faults, he has this merit as well as some others, that he went 
willingly on pilgrimage always, and took others, promoting always
love of comrades, fun, and humorous by-play.&nbsp; The latest 
great romancer, too, took his side: like Dickens, he was here 
full brother of Dan Chaucer, and followed him.&nbsp; How 
characteristic it is when he tells Mr Trigg that he preferred 
Samoa to Honolulu because it was more savage, and therefore 
yielded more <i>fun</i>.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXX&mdash;LORD ROSEBERY&rsquo;S CASE</h2>
<p>Immediately on reading Lord Rosebery&rsquo;s address as 
Chairman of the meeting in Edinburgh to promote the erection of a
monument to R. L. Stevenson, I wrote to him politely asking him 
whether, since he quoted a passage from a somewhat early essay by
Stevenson naming the authors who had chiefly influenced him in 
point of style, his Lordship should not, merely in justice and 
for the sake of balance, have referred to Thoreau.&nbsp; I also 
remarked that Stevenson&rsquo;s later style sometimes showed too 
much self-conscious conflict of his various models in his mind 
while he was in the act of writing, and that this now and then 
imparted too much an air of artifice to his later compositions, 
and that those who knew most would be most troubled by it.&nbsp; 
Of that letter, I much regret now that I did not keep any copy; 
but I think I did incidentally refer to the friendship with which
Stevenson had for so many years honoured me.&nbsp; This is a copy
of the letter received in reply:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;38 <span 
class="smcap">Berkeley Square</span>, W.,<br />

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am much 
obliged for your letter, and can only state that the name of 
Thoreau was not mentioned by Stevenson himself, and therefore I 
could not cite it in my quotation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With regard to the style of Stevenson&rsquo;s later 
works, I am inclined to agree with you.-Believe me, yours very 
faithfully,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span 
class="smcap">Rosebery</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr <span class="smcap">Alexander H.

<p>This I at once replied to as follows:</p>

L. Stevenson did not refer to Thoreau in the passage to which you
allude, for the good reason that he could not, since he did not 
know Thoreau till after it was written; but if you will oblige me
and be so good as to turn to p. xix. of Preface, <i>By Way of 
Criticism</i>, to <i>Familiar Studies of Men and Books</i> you 
will read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Upon me this pure, narrow, sunnily-ascetic 
Thoreau had exercised a wondrous charm.&nbsp; <i>I have scarce 
written ten sentences since I was introduced to him</i>, <i>but 
his influence might be somewhere detected by a close 
observer</i>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very detectable in many passages of 
nature-description and of reflection.&nbsp; I write, my Lord, 
merely that, in case opportunity should arise, you might notice 
this fact.&nbsp; I am sure R. L. Stevenson would have liked it 
recognised.&mdash;I remain, my Lord, always yours faithfully, 
etc.,</p>

</a></p>
<p>In reply to this Lord Rosebery sent me only the most formal 
acknowledgment, not in the least encouraging me in any way to 
further aid him in the matter with regard to suggestions of any 
kind; so that I was helpless to press on his lordship the need 
for some corrections on other points which I would most willingly
have tendered to him had he shown himself inclined or ready to 
receive them.</p>
<p>I might also have referred Lord Rosebery to the article in 
<i>The British Weekly</i> (<i>1887</i>), &ldquo;Books that have 
Influenced Me,&rdquo; where, after having spoken of Shakespeare, 
the <i>Vicomte de Bragelonne</i>, Bunyan, Montaigne, Goethe, 
Martial, Marcus Aurelius&rsquo;s <i>Meditations</i>, and 
Wordsworth, he proceeds:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;I suppose, when I am done, I shall find 
that I have forgotten much that is influential, as I see already 
I have forgotten Thoreau.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I need but to add to what has been said already that, had Lord
Rosebery written and told me the result of his references and 
encouraged me to such an exercise, I should by-and-by have been 
very pleased to point out to him that he blundered, proving 
himself no master in Burns&rsquo; literature, precisely as Mr 
Henley blundered about Burns&rsquo; ancestry, when he gives 
confirmation to the idea that Burns came of a race of peasants on
both sides, and was himself nothing but a peasant.</p>
<p>When the opportunity came to correct such blunders, 
corrections which I had even implored him to make, Lord Rosebery 
(who by several London papers had been spoken of as 
&ldquo;knowing more than all the experts about all his 
themes&rdquo;), that is, when his volume was being prepared for 
press, did not act on my good advice given him 
&ldquo;<i>free</i>, <i>gratis</i>, <i>for nothing</i>&rdquo;; no;
he contented himself with simply slicing out columns from the 
<i>Times</i>, or allowing another man to do so for him, and 
reprinting them <i>literatim et verbatim</i>, all imperfect and 
misleading, as they stood.&nbsp; <i>Scripta manet</i> alas! only 
too truly exemplified to his disadvantage.&nbsp; But with that 
note of mine in his hand, protesting against an ominous and fatal
omission as regards the confessed influences that had operated on
Stevenson, he goes on, or allows Mr Geake to go on, quite as 
though he had verified matters and found that I was wrong as 
regards the facts on which I based my appeal to him for 
recognition of Thoreau as having influenced Stevenson in 
style.&nbsp; Had he attended to correcting his serious errors 
about Stevenson, and some at least of those about Burns, thus 
adding, say, a dozen or twenty pages to his book wholly fresh and
new and accurate, then the <i>Times</i> could not have got, even 
if it had sought, an injunction against his publishers and him; 
and there would have been no necessity that he should pad out 
other and later speeches by just a little whining over what was 
entirely due to his own disregard of good advice, his own 
neglect&mdash;his own fault&mdash;a neglect and a fault showing 
determination not to revise where revision in justice to his 
subject&rsquo;s own free and frank acknowledgments made it most 
essential and necessary.</p>
<p>Mr Justice North gave his decision against Lord Rosebery and 
his publishers, while the Lords of Appeal went in his favour; but
the House of Lords reaffirmed the decision of Mr Justice North 
and granted a perpetual injunction against this book.&nbsp; The 
copyright in his speech is Lord Rosebery&rsquo;s, but the 
copyright in the <i>Times</i>&rsquo; report is the 
<i>Times</i>&rsquo;.&nbsp; You see one of the ideas underlying 
the law is that no manner of speech is quite perfect as the man 
speaks it, or is beyond revision, improvement, or extension, and,
if there is but one <i>verbatim</i> report, as was the case of 
some of these speeches and addresses, then it is incumbent on the
author, if he wishes to preserve his copyright, to revise and 
correct his speeches and addresses, so as to make them at least 
in details so far differ from the reported form.&nbsp; This thing
ought Lord Rosebery to have done, on ethical and literary 
<i>grounds</i>, not to speak of legal and self-interested 
grounds; and I, for one, who from the first held exactly the view
the House of Lords has affirmed, do confess that I have no 
sympathy for Lord Rosebery, since he had before him the 
suggestion and the materials for as substantial alterations and 
additions from my own hands, with as much more for other portions
of his book, had he informed me of his appreciation, as would 
have saved him and his book from such a sadly ironical fate as 
has overtaken him and it.</p>
<p>From the whole business&mdash;since &ldquo;free, gratis, for 
nothing,&rdquo; I offered him as good advice as any lawyer in the
three kingdoms could have done for large payment, and since he 
never deemed it worth while, even to tell me the results of his 
reference to <i>Familiar Studies</i>, I here and now say 
deliberately that his conduct to me was scarcely so courteous and
grateful and graceful as it might have been.&nbsp; How 
different&mdash;very different&mdash;the way in which the late R.
L. Stevenson rewarded me for a literary service no whit greater 
or more essentially valuable to him than this service rendered to
Lord Rosebery might have been to him.</p>
<p>This chapter would most probably not have been printed, had 
not Mr Coates re-issued the inadequate and most misleading 
paragraph about Mr Stevenson and style in his Lord 
Rosebery&rsquo;s <i>Life and Speeches</i> exactly as it was 
before, thus perpetuating at once the error and the wrong, in 
spite of all my trouble, warnings, and protests.&nbsp; It is a 
tragicomedy, if not a farce altogether, considering who are the 
principal actors in it.&nbsp; And let those who have copies of 
the queer prohibited book cherish them and thank me; for that I 
do by this give a new interest and value to it as a curiosity, 
law-inhibited, if not as high and conscientious 
literature&mdash;which it is not.</p>
<p>I remember very well about the time Lord Rosebery spoke on 
Burns, and Stevenson, and London, that certain London papers 
spoke of his deliverances as indicating more 
knowledge&mdash;fuller and exacter knowledge&mdash;of all these 
subjects than the greatest professed experts possessed.&nbsp; 
That is their extravagant and most reckless way, especially if 
the person spoken about is a &ldquo;great politician&rdquo; or a 
man of rank.&nbsp; They think they are safe with such 
superlatives applied to a brilliant and clever peer (with large 
estates and many interests), and an ex-Prime Minister!&nbsp; But 
literature is a republic, and it must here be said, though all 
unwillingly, that Lord Rosebery is but an amateur&mdash;a 
superficial though a clever amateur after all, and their 
extravagances do not change the fact.&nbsp; I declare him an 
amateur in Burns&rsquo; literature and study because of what I 
have said elsewhere, and there are many points to add to that if 
need were.&nbsp; I have proved above from his own words that he 
was crassly and unpardonably ignorant of some of the most 
important points in R. L. Stevenson&rsquo;s development when he 
delivered that address in Edinburgh on Stevenson&mdash;a thing 
very, very pardonable&mdash;seeing that he is run after to do 
&ldquo;speakings&rdquo; of this sort; but to go on, in face of 
such warning and protest, printing his most misleading errors is 
not pardonable, and the legal recorded result is my justification
and his condemnation, the more surely that even that would not 
awaken him so far as to cause him to restrain Mr Coates from 
reproducing in his <i>Life and Speeches</i>, just as it was 
originally, that peccant passage.&nbsp; I am fully ready to prove
also that, though Chairman of the London County Council for a 
period, and though he made a very clever address at one of Sir W.
Besant&rsquo;s lectures, there is much yet&mdash;very 
much&mdash;he might learn from Sir W. Besant&rsquo;s writings on 
London.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t so easy to outshine all the 
experts&mdash;even for a clever peer who has been Prime Minister,
though it is very, very easy to flatter Lord Rosebery, with a 
purpose or purposes, as did at least once also with rarest tact, 
at Glasgow, indicating so many other things and possibilities, a 
certain very courtly ex-Moderator of the Church of Scotland.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXI&mdash;MR GOSSE AND MS. OF <i>TREASURE 
ISLAND</i></h2>
<p>Mr Edmund Gosse has been so good as to set down, with rather 
an air of too much authority, that both R. L. Stevenson and I 
deceived ourselves completely in the matter of my little share in
the <i>Treasure Island</i> business, and that too much credit was
sought by me or given to me, for the little service I rendered to
R. L. Stevenson, and to the world, say, in helping to secure for 
it an element of pleasure through many generations.&nbsp; I have 
not <i>sought</i> any recognition from the world in this matter, 
and even the mention of it became so intolerable to me that I 
eschewed all writing about it, in the face of the most stupid and
misleading statements, till Mr Sidney Colvin wrote and asked me 
to set down my account of the matter in my own words.&nbsp; This 
I did, as it would have been really rude to refuse a request so 
graciously made, and the reader has it in the <i>Academy</i> of 
10th March 1900.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Mr Gosse&rsquo;s statements 
were revived and quoted, and the thing seemed ever to revolve 
again in a round of controversy.</p>
<p>Now, with regard to the reliability in this matter of Mr 
Edmund Gosse, let me copy here a little note made at request some
time ago, dealing with two points.&nbsp; The first is this:</p>
<p>1. <i>Most assuredly</i> I carried away from Braemar in my 
portmanteau, as R. L. Stevenson says in <i>Idler&rsquo;s</i> 
article and in chapter of <i>My First Book</i> reprinted in 
<i>Edinburgh Edition</i>, several chapters of <i>Treasure 
Island</i>.&nbsp; On that point R. L. Stevenson, myself, and Mr 
James Henderson, to whom I took these, could not all be wrong and
co-operating to mislead the public.&nbsp; These chapters, at 
least vii. or viii., as Mr Henderson remembers, would include the
<i>first three</i>, that is, <i>finally revised versions for 
press</i>.&nbsp; Mr Gosse could not then <i>have heard R. L. 
Stevenson read from these final versions but from first 
draughts</i> <span class="smcap">only</span>, and I am positively
certain that with some of the later chapters R. L. Stevenson 
wrote them off-hand, and with great ease, and did not revise them
to the extent of at all needing to re-write them, as I remember 
he was proud to tell me, being then fully in the vein, as he put 
it, and pleased to credit me with a share in this good result, 
and saying &ldquo;my enthusiasm over it had set him up 
steep.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was then, in my idea, a necessity that 
Stevenson should fill up a gap by verbal summary to Mr Gosse 
(which Mr Gosse has forgotten), bringing the incident up to a 
further point than Mr Gosse now thinks.&nbsp; I am certain of my 
facts under this head; and as Mr Gosse clearly fancies he heard 
R. L. Stevenson read all from final versions and is 
mistaken&mdash;<i>completely</i> mistaken there&mdash;he may be 
just as wrong and the victim of error or bad memory elsewhere 
after the lapse of more than twenty years.</p>
<p>2. I gave the pencilled outline of incident and plot to Mr 
Henderson&mdash;a fact he distinctly remembers.&nbsp; This fact 
completely meets and disposes of Mr Robert Leighton&rsquo;s quite
imaginative <i>Billy Bo&rsquo;sun</i> notion, and is absolute as 
to R. L. Stevenson before he left Braemar on the 21st September 
1881, or even before I left it on 26th August 1881, having clear 
in his mind the whole scheme of the work, though we know very 
well that the absolute re-writing out finally for press of the 
concluding part of the book was done at Davos.&nbsp; Mr Henderson
has always made it the strictest rule in his editorship that the 
complete outline of the plot and incident of the latter part of a
story must be supplied to him, if the whole story is not 
submitted to him in MS.; and the agreement, if I am not much 
mistaken, was entered into days before R. L. Stevenson left 
Braemar, and when he came up to London some short time after to 
go to Weybridge, the only arrangement then needed to be made was 
about the forwarding of proofs to him.</p>
<p>The publication of <i>Treasure Island</i> in <i>Young 
Folks</i> began on the 1st October 1881, No. 565 and ran on in 
the following order:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>October</i> 1, 
1881.<br />
THE PROLOGUE</p>
<p>No. 565.<br />
I. The Old Sea Dog at the Admiral Benbow.<br />
II. Black Dog Appears and Disappears.</p>
<p>No. 566.<br />
Dated <i>October</i> 8, 1881.<br />
III. The Black Spot.</p>
<p>No. 567.<br />
Dated <i>October</i> 15, 1881.<br />
IV. The Sea Chart.<br />
V. The Last of the Blind Man.<br />
VI. The Captain&rsquo;s Papers.</p>
<p>No. 568.<br />
Dated <i>October</i> 22, 1881.<br />
THE STORY<br />
I. I go to Bristol.<br />
II. The Sea-Cook.<br />
Ill.&nbsp; Powder and Arms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, as the numbers of <i>Young Folks</i> were printed about a
fortnight in advance of the date they bear under the title, it is
clear that not only must the contract have been executed days 
before the middle of September, but that a large proportion of 
the <i>copy</i> must have been in Mr Henderson&rsquo;s hands at 
that date too, as he must have been entirely satisfied that the 
story would go on and be finished in a definite time.&nbsp; On no
other terms would he have begun the publication of it.&nbsp; He 
was not in the least likely to have accepted a story from a man 
who, though known as an essayist, had not yet published anything 
in the way of a long story, on the ground merely of three 
chapters of prologue.&nbsp; Mr Gosse left Braemar on 5th 
September, when he says nine chapters were written, and Mr 
Henderson had offered terms for the story before the last of 
these could have reached him.&nbsp; That is on seeing, say six 
chapters of prologue.&nbsp; But when Mr Gosse speaks about three 
chapters only written, does he mean three of the prologue or 
three of the story, in addition to prologue, or what does he 
mean?&nbsp; The facts are clear.&nbsp; I took away in my 
portmanteau a large portion of the MS., together with a very full
outline of the rest of the story, so that Mr Stevenson was, 
despite Mr Gosse&rsquo;s cavillings, <i>substantially</i> right 
when he wrote in <i>My First Book</i> in the <i>Idler</i>, etc., 
that &ldquo;when he (Dr Japp) left us he carried away the 
manuscript in his portmanteau.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was nothing of 
the nature of an abandonment of the story at any point, nor any 
difficulty whatever arose in this respect in regard to it.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXII&mdash;STEVENSON PORTRAITS</h2>
<p>Of the portraits of Stevenson a word or two may be said.&nbsp;
There is a very good early photograph of him, taken not very long
before the date of my visit to him at Braemar in 1881, and is an 
admirable likeness&mdash;characteristic not only in expression, 
but in pose and attitude, for it fixes him in a favourite 
position of his; and is, at the same time, very easy and 
natural.&nbsp; The velvet jacket, as I have remarked, was then 
his habitual wear, and the thin fingers holding the constant 
cigarette an inseparable associate and accompaniment.</p>
<p>He acknowledged himself that he was a difficult subject to 
paint&mdash;not at all a good sitter&mdash;impatient and apt to 
rebel at posing and time spent in arrangement of details&mdash;a 
fact he has himself, as we shall see, set on record in his funny 
verses to Count Nerli, who painted as successful a portrait as 
any.&nbsp; The little miniature, full-length, by Mr J. S. 
Sarjent, A.R.A., which was painted at Bournemouth in 1885, is 
confessedly a mere sketch and much of a caricature: it is in 
America.&nbsp; Sir W. B. Richmond has an unfinished portrait, 
painted in 1885 or 1886&mdash;it has never passed out of the 
hands of the artist,&mdash;a photogravure from it is our 
frontispiece.</p>
<p>There is a medallion done by St Gauden&rsquo;s, representing 
Stevenson in bed propped up by pillows.&nbsp; It is thought to be
a pretty good likeness, and it is now in Mr Sidney Colvin&rsquo;s
possession.&nbsp; Others, drawings, etc., are not of much 
account.</p>
<p>And now we come to the Nerli portrait, of which so much has 
been written.&nbsp; Stevenson himself regarded it as the best 
portrait of him ever painted, and certainly it also is 
characteristic and effective, and though not what may be called a
pleasant likeness, is probably a good representation of him in 
the later years of his life.&nbsp; Count Nerli actually undertook
a voyage to Samoa in 1892, mainly with the idea of painting this 
portrait.&nbsp; He and Stevenson became great friends, as 
Stevenson na&iuml;vely tells in the verses we have already 
referred to, but even this did not quite overcome 
Stevenson&rsquo;s restlessness.&nbsp; He avenged himself by 
composing these verses as he sat:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did ever mortal man hear tell o&rsquo; sic a 
ticklin&rsquo; ferlie<br />
As the comin&rsquo; on to Apia here o&rsquo; the painter Mr 
Nerli?<br />
He cam&rsquo;; and, O, for o&rsquo; human freen&rsquo;s o&rsquo; 
a&rsquo; he was the pearlie&mdash;<br />
The pearl o&rsquo; a&rsquo; the painter folk was surely Mr 
Nerli.<br />
He took a thraw to paint mysel&rsquo;; he painted late and 
early;<br />
O wow! the many a yawn I&rsquo;ve yawned i&rsquo; the beard 
o&rsquo; Mr Nerli.<br />
Whiles I wad sleep and whiles wad wake, an&rsquo; whiles was mair
than surly;<br />
I wondered sair as I sat there fornent the eyes o&rsquo; 
Nerli.<br />
O will he paint me the way I want, as bonnie as a girlie?<br />
O will he paint me an ugly tyke?&mdash;and be d-d to Mr Nerli.<br
/>
But still an&rsquo; on whichever it be, he is a canty kerlie,<br 
/>
The Lord protect the back an&rsquo; neck o&rsquo; honest Mr 
Nerli.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Hammerton gives this account of the Nerli portrait:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The history of the Nerli portrait is 
peculiar.&nbsp; After being exhibited for some time in New 
Zealand it was bought, in the course of this year, by a lady who 
was travelling there, for a hundred guineas.&nbsp; She then 
offered it for that sum to the Scottish National Portrait 
Gallery; but the Trustees of the Board of Manufactures&mdash;that
oddly named body to which is entrusted the fostering care of Art 
in Scotland, and, in consequence, the superintendence of the 
National Portrait Gallery&mdash;did not see their way to accept 
the offer.&nbsp; Some surprise has been expressed at the action 
of the Trustees in thus declining to avail themselves of the 
opportunity of obtaining the portrait of one of the most 
distinguished Scotsmen of recent times.&nbsp; It can hardly have 
been for want of money, for though the funds at their disposal 
for the purchase of ordinary works of art are but limited, no 
longer ago than last year they were the recipients of a very 
handsome legacy from the late Mr J. M. Gray, the accomplished and
much lamented Curator of the Scottish National Portrait 
Gallery&mdash;a legacy left them for the express purpose of 
acquiring portraits of distinguished Scotsmen, and the income of 
which was amply sufficient to have enabled them to purchase this 
portrait.&nbsp; One is therefore almost shut up to the conclusion
that the Trustees were influenced in their decision by one of the
two following reasons:</p>
<p>&ldquo;1. That they did not consider Stevenson worthy of a 
place in the gallery.&nbsp; This is a position so 
incomprehensible and so utterly opposed to public sentiment that 
one can hardly credit it having been the cause of this 
refusal.&nbsp; Whatever may be the place which Stevenson may 
ultimately take as an author, and however opinions may differ as 
to the merits of his work, no one can deny that he was one of the
most popular writers of his day, and that as a mere master of 
style, if for nothing else, his works will be read so long as 
there are students of English Literature.&nbsp; Surely the 
portrait of one for whom such a claim may legitimately be made 
cannot be considered altogether unworthy of a place in the 
National Collection, as one of Scotland&rsquo;s most 
distinguished sons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;2. The only other reason which can be suggested as 
having weighed with the Trustees in their decision is one which 
in some cases might be held to be worthy of consideration.&nbsp; 
It is conceivable that in the case of some men the Trustees might
be of opinion that there was plenty of time to consider the 
matter, and that in the meantime there was always the chance of 
some generous donor presenting them with a portrait.&nbsp; But, 
as has been shown above, the portraits of Stevenson are 
practically confined to two: one of these is in America, and 
there is not the least chance of its ever coming here; and the 
other they have refused.&nbsp; And, as it is understood that the 
Trustees have a rule that they do not accept any portrait which 
has not been painted from the life, they preclude themselves from
acquiring a copy of any existing picture or even a portrait done 
from memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is rumoured that the Nerli portrait may ultimately 
find a resting-place in the National Collection of Portraits in 
London.&nbsp; If this should prove to be the case, what a 
commentary on the old saying: &lsquo;A prophet is not without 
honour save in his own country.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII&mdash;LAPSES AND ERRORS IN CRITICISM</h2>
<p>Nothing could perhaps be more wearisome than to travel 
o&rsquo;er the wide sandy area of Stevenson criticism and 
commentary, and expose the many and sad and grotesque errors that
meet one there.&nbsp; Mr Baildon&rsquo;s slip is innocent, 
compared with many when he says (p. 106) <i>Treasure Island</i> 
appeared in <i>Young Folks</i> as <i>The Sea-Cook</i>.&nbsp; It 
did nothing of the kind; it is on plain record in print, even in 
the pages of the <i>Edinburgh Edition</i>, that Mr James 
Henderson would not have the title <i>The Sea-Cook</i>, as he did
not like it, and insisted on its being <i>Treasure 
Island</i>.&nbsp; To him, therefore, the vastly better title is 
due.&nbsp; Mr Henley was in doubt if Mr Henderson was still alive
when he wrote the brilliant and elevated article on &ldquo;Some 
Novels&rdquo; in the <i>North American</i>, and as a certain dark
bird killed Cock Robin, so he killed off Dr Japp, and not to be 
outdone, got in an ideal &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; <i>Jack</i>; so Mr
Baildon there follows Henley, unaware that Mr Henderson did not 
like <i>The Sea-Cook</i>, and was still alive, and that a certain
Jack in the fatal <i>North American</i> has Japp&rsquo;s 
credit.</p>
<p>Mr Baildon&rsquo;s words are:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;This was the famous book of adventure, 
<i>Treasure Island</i>, appearing first as <i>The Sea-Cook</i> in
a boy&rsquo;s paper, where it made no great stir.&nbsp; But, on 
its publication in volume form, with the vastly better title, the
book at once &lsquo;boomed,&rsquo; as the phrase goes, to an 
extent then, in 1882, almost unprecedented.&nbsp; The secret of 
its immense success may almost be expressed in a phrase by saying
that it is a book like <i>Gulliver&rsquo;s Travels</i>, <i>The 
Pilgrim&rsquo;s Progress</i>, and <i>Robinson Crusoe</i> itself 
for all ages&mdash;boys, men, and women.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which just shows how far lapse as to a fact may lead to 
critical misreadings also.</p>
<p>Mr Hammerton sometimes lets good folks say in his pages, 
without correction, what is certainly not correct.&nbsp; Thus at 
one place we are told that Stevenson was only known as Louis in 
print, whereas that was the only name by which he was known in 
his own family.&nbsp; Then Mr Gosse, at p. 34, is allowed to 
write:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Professor Blackie was among them on the 
steamer from the Hebrides, a famous figure that calls for no 
description, and a voluble shaggy man, clad in homespun, with 
spectacles forward upon his nose, who it was whispered to us, was
Mr Sam Bough, the Scottish Academician, <i>a water-colour painter
of some repute</i>, who was to die in 1878.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Sam Bough <i>was</i> &ldquo;a water-colour painter of some 
repute,&rdquo; but a painter in oils of yet greater 
repute&mdash;a man of rare strength, resource, and 
facility&mdash;never, perhaps, wholly escaping from some traces 
of his early experiences in scene-painting, but a true genius in 
his art.&nbsp; Ah, well I remember him, though an older man, yet 
youthful in the band of young Scotch artists among whom as a 
youngster I was privileged to move in Edinburgh&mdash;Pettie, 
Chalmers, M&rsquo;Whirter, Peter Graham, MacTaggart, MacDonald, 
John Burr, and Bough.&nbsp; Bough could be voluble on art; and 
many a talk I had with him as with the others named, especially 
with John Burr.&nbsp; Bough and he both could talk as well as 
paint, and talk right well.&nbsp; Bough had a slight cast in the 
eye; when he got a <i>wee</i> excited on his subject he would 
come close to you with head shaking, and spectacles displaced, 
and forelock wagging, and the cast would seem to die away.&nbsp; 
Was this a fact, or was it an illusion on my part?&nbsp; I have 
often asked myself that question, and now I ask it of 
others.&nbsp; Can any of my good friends in Edinburgh say; can Mr
Caw help me here, either to confirm or to correct me?&nbsp; I 
venture to insert here an anecdote, with which my friend of old 
days, Mr Wm. MacTaggart, R.S.A., in a letter kindly favours 
me:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Sam Bough was a very sociable man; and, 
when on a sketching tour, liked to have a young artist or two 
with him.&nbsp; Jack Nisbett played the violin, and Sam the 
&rsquo;cello, etc.&nbsp; Jack was fond of telling that Sam used 
to let them all choose the best views, and then he would take 
what was left; and Jack, with mild astonishment, would say, that 
&lsquo;it generally turned out to be the best&mdash;on the 
canvas!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In Mr Hammerton&rsquo;s copy of the verses in reply to Mr 
Crockett&rsquo;s dedication of <i>The Stickit Minister</i> to 
Stevenson, in which occurred the fine phrase &ldquo;The grey 
Galloway lands, where about the graves of the martyrs the whaups 
are crying, his heart remembers how&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Blows the wind to-day and the sun and the 
rain are flying:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blows the wind on the moors to-day and now,<br />
Where about the graves of the martyrs the whaups are crying,<br 
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; My heart remembers how.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grey recumbent tombs of the dead in desert places,<br 
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Standing stones on the vacant wine-red moor,<br />
Hills of sheep, and the <i>homes</i> of the silent vanished 
races,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And winds austere and pure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it granted me to behold you again in dying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Hills of home! and to hear again the call&mdash;<br 
/>
Hear about the graves of the martyrs the pee-weet crying,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And hear no more at all.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr Hammerton prints <i>howes</i> instead of <i>homes</i>, 
which I have italicised above.&nbsp; And I may note, though it 
does not affect the poetry, if it does a little affect the 
natural history, that the <i>pee-weets</i> and the whaups are not
the same&mdash;the one is the curlew, and the other is the 
lapwing&mdash;the one most frequenting wild, heathery or peaty 
moorland, and the other pasture or even ploughed land&mdash;so 
that it is a great pity for unity and simplicity alike that 
Stevenson did not repeat the &ldquo;whaup,&rdquo; but wrote 
rather as though pee-weet or pee-weets were the same as 
whaups&mdash;the common call of the one is <i>Ker-lee</i>, 
<i>ker-lee</i>, and of the other <i>pee-weet</i>, 
<i>pee-weet</i>, hence its common name.</p>
<p>It is a pity, too, that Mr Hammerton has no records of some 
portions of the life at Davos Platz.&nbsp; Not only was Stevenson
ill there in April 1892, but his wife collapsed, and the tender 
concern for her made havoc with some details of his literary 
work.&nbsp; It is good to know this.&nbsp; Such errata or 
omissions throw a finer light on his character than controlling 
perfection would do.&nbsp; Ah, I remember how my old friend W. B.
Rands (&ldquo;Matthew Browne&rdquo; and &ldquo;Henry 
Holbeach&rdquo;) was wont to declare that were men perfect they 
would be isolated, if not idiotic, that we are united to each 
other by our defects&mdash;that even physical beauty would be 
dead like later Greek statues, were these not departures from the
perfect lines.&nbsp; The letter given by me at p. 28 transfigures
in its light, some of his work at that time.</p>
<p>And then what an opportunity, we deeply regret to say, Mr 
Hammerton wholly missed, when he passed over without due 
explanation or commentary that most significant 
pamphlet&mdash;the <i>Address to the Scottish Clergy</i>.&nbsp; 
If Mr Hammerton had but duly and closely studied that and its 
bearings and suggestions in many directions, then he would have 
written such a chapter for true enlightenment and for interest as
exactly his book&mdash;attractive though it is in much&mdash;yet 
specially lacks.&nbsp; It is to be hoped that Mr Sidney Colvin 
will not once more miss the chance which is thus still left open 
to him to perfect his <i>Life of Stevenson</i>, and make it more 
interpretive than anything yet published.&nbsp; If he does this, 
then, a dreadful <i>lacuna</i> in the <i>Edinburgh Edition</i> 
will also be supplied.</p>
<p>Carefully reading over again Mr Arthur Symons&rsquo; 
<i>Studies in Two Literatures</i>&mdash;published some years 
ago&mdash;I have come across instances of apparent contradiction 
which, so far as I can see, he does not critically altogether 
reconcile, despite his ingenuity and great charm of style.&nbsp; 
One relates to Thoreau, who, while still &ldquo;sturdy&rdquo; as 
Emerson says, &ldquo;and like an elm tree,&rdquo; as his sister 
Sophia says, showed exactly the same love of nature and power of 
interpreting her as he did after in his later comparatively short
period of &ldquo;invalidity,&rdquo; while Mr Symons says his view
of Nature absolutely was that of the invalid, classing him 
unqualifiedly with Jefferies and Stevenson, as invalid.&nbsp; 
Thoreau&rsquo;s mark even in the short later period of 
&ldquo;invalidity&rdquo; was complete and robust independence and
triumph over it&mdash;a thing which I have no doubt wholly 
captivated Stevenson, as scarce anything else would have done, as
a victory in the exact <i>r&ocirc;le</i> he himself was most 
ambitious to fill.&nbsp; For did not he too wrestle well with the
&ldquo;wolverine&rdquo; he carried on his back&mdash;in this like
Addington Symonds and Alexander Pope?&nbsp; Surely I cannot be 
wrong here to reinforce my statement by a passage from a letter 
written by Sophia Thoreau to her good friend Daniel Ricketson, 
after her brother&rsquo;s death, the more that R. L. Stevenson 
would have greatly exulted too in its cheery and invincible 
stoicism:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Profound joy mingles with my grief.&nbsp; I
feel as if something very beautiful had happened&mdash;not death;
although Henry is with us no longer, yet the memory of his sweet 
and virtuous soul must ever cheer and comfort me.&nbsp; My heart 
is filled with praise to God for the gift of such a brother, and 
may I never distrust the love and wisdom of Him who made him and 
who has now called him to labour in more glorious fields than 
earth affords.&nbsp; You ask for some particulars relating to 
Henry&rsquo;s illness.&nbsp; I feel like saying that Henry was 
never affected, never reached by it.&nbsp; I never before saw 
such a manifestation of the power of spirit over matter.&nbsp; 
Very often I heard him tell his visitors that he enjoyed 
existence as well as ever.&nbsp; The thought of death, he said, 
did not trouble him.&nbsp; His thoughts had entertained him all 
his life and did still. . . . He considered occupation as 
necessary for the sick as for those in health, and accomplished a
vast amount of labour in those last few months.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A rare &ldquo;invalidity&rdquo; this&mdash;a little confusing 
easy classifications.&nbsp; I think Stevenson would have felt and
said that brother and sister were well worthy of each other; and 
that the sister was almost as grand and cheery a stoic, with no 
literary profession of it, as was the brother.</p>
<p>The other thing relates to Stevenson&rsquo;s <i>human 
soul</i>.&nbsp; I find Mr Symons says, at p. 243, that Stevenson 
&ldquo;had something a trifle elfish and uncanny about him, as of
a bewitched being who was not actually human&mdash;had not 
actually a human soul&rdquo;&mdash;in which there may be a 
glimmer of truth viewed from his revelation of artistic 
curiosities in some aspects, but is hardly true of him otherwise;
and this Mr Symons himself seems to have felt, when, at p. 246, 
he writes: &ldquo;He is one of those writers who speak <i>to us 
on easy terms</i>, with whom we <i>may exchange 
affections</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; How &ldquo;affections&rdquo; could 
be exchanged on easy terms between the normal human being and an 
elfish creature actually <i>without a human soul</i> (seeing that
affections are, as Mr Matthew Arnold might have said, at least, 
three-fourths of soul) is more, I confess, than I can quite see 
at present; but in this rather <i>maladroit</i> contradiction Mr 
Symons does point at one phase of the problem of 
Stevenson&mdash;this, namely that to all the ordinary happy or 
pleasure-endings he opposes, as it were of set purpose, gloom, as
though to certain things he was quite indifferent, and though, as
we have seen, his actual life and practice were quite opposed to 
this.</p>
<p>I am sorry I <i>cannot</i> find the link in Mr Symons&rsquo; 
essay, which would quite make these two statements consistently 
coincide critically.&nbsp; As an enthusiastic, though I hope 
still a discriminating, Stevensonian, I do wish Mr Symons would 
help us to it somehow hereafter.&nbsp; It would be well worth his
doing, in my opinion.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV&mdash;LETTERS AND POEMS IN TESTIMONY</h2>
<p>Among many letters received by me in acknowledgment of, or in 
commentary on, my little tributes to R. L. Stevenson, in various 
journals and magazines, I find the following, which I give here 
for reasons purely personal, and because my readers may with me, 
join in admiration of the fancy, grace and beauty of the 
poems.&nbsp; I must preface the first poem by a letter, which 
explains the genesis of the poem, and relates a striking and very
touching incident:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;37 <span 
class="smcap">St Donatt&rsquo;s Road</span>,<br />
<span class="smcap">Lewisham High Road</span>, S.E.,<br />
1<i>st</i> <i>March</i> 1895.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;As you have 
written so much about your friend, the late Robert Louis 
Stevenson, and quoted many tributes to his genius from 
contemporary writers, I take the liberty of sending you herewith 
some verses of mine which appeared in <i>The Weekly Sun</i> of 
November last.&nbsp; I sent a copy of these verses to Samoa, but 
unfortunately the great novelist died before they reached 
it.&nbsp; I have, however, this week, received a little note from
Mrs Strong, which runs as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your poem of &ldquo;Greeting&rdquo; came too 
late.&nbsp; I can only thank you by sending a little moss that I 
plucked from a tree overhanging his grave on Vaea 
Mountain.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust you will appreciate my motive in sending you 
the poem.&nbsp; I do not wish to obtrude my claims as a 
verse-writer upon your notice, but I thought the incident I have 
recited would be interesting to one who is so devoted a collector
of Stevensoniana.&mdash;Respectfully yours,</p>
<p><span class="smcap">F. J. Cox</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>GREETING</h3>
<p>(TO ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON, IN SAMOA)</p>
<p>We, pent in cities, prisoned in the mart,<br />
Can know you only as a man apart,<br />
But ever-present through your matchless art.</p>
<p>You have exchanged the old, familiar ways<br />
For isles, where, through the range of splendid days,<br />
Her treasure Nature lavishly displays.</p>
<p>There, by the gracious sweep of ampler seas,<br />
That swell responsive to the odorous breeze.<br />
You have the wine of Life, and we the lees!</p>
<p>You mark, perchance, within your island bowers,<br />
The slow departure of the languorous hours,<br />
And breathe the sweetness of the strange wild-flowers.</p>
<p>And everything your soul and sense delights&mdash;<br />
But in the solemn wonder of your nights,<br />
When Peace her message on the landscape writes;</p>
<p>When Ocean scarcely flecks her marge with foam&mdash;<br />
Your thoughts must sometimes from your island roam,<br />
To centre on the sober face of Home.</p>
<p>Though many a league of water rolls between<br />
The simple beauty of an English scene,<br />
From all these wilder charms your love may wean.</p>
<p>Some kindly sprite may bring you as a boon<br />
Sweets from the rose that crowns imperial June,<br />
Or reminiscence of the throstle&rsquo;s tune;</p>
<p>Yea, gladly grant you, with a generous hand,<br />
Far glimpses of the winding, wind-swept strand,<br />
The glens and mountains of your native land,</p>
<p>Until you hear the pipes upon the breeze&mdash;<br />
But wake unto the wild realities<br />
The tangled forests and the boundless seas!</p>
<p>For lo! the moonless night has passed away,<br />
A sudden dawn dispels the shadows grey,<br />
The glad sea moves and hails the quickening day.</p>
<p>New life within the arbours of your fief<br />
Awakes the blossom, quivers in the leaf,<br />
And splendour flames upon the coral reef.</p>
<p>If such a prospect stimulate your art,<br />
More than our meadows where the shadows dart,<br />
More than the life which throbs in London&rsquo;s heart,</p>
<p>Then stay, encircled by your Southern bowers,<br />
And weave, amid the incense of the flowers,<br />
The skein of fair romance&mdash;the gain is ours!</p>

<h3>R. L. S., IN MEMORIAM.</h3>
<p>An elfin wight as e&rsquo;er from faeryland<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Came to us straight with favour in his eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of wondrous seed that led him to the prize<br />
Of fancy, with the magic rod in hand.<br />
Ah, there in faeryland we saw him stand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As for a while he walked with smiles and sighs,<br 
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Amongst us, finding still the gem that buys<br />
Delight and joy at genius&rsquo;s command.</p>
<p>And now thy place is empty: fare thee well;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou livest still in hearts that owe thee more<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than gold can reckon; for thy richer store<br />
Is of the good that with us aye most dwell.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Farewell; sleep sound on Vaea&rsquo;s windy 
shrine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; While round the songsters join their song to 
thine.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>
<p>The following appeared some time ago in one of the London 
evening papers, and I make bold, because of its truth and vigour,
to insert it here:</p>
<h3>THE LAND OF STEVENSON,<br />
<i>ON AN AFTERNOON&rsquo;S WALK</i></h3>
<p>Will there be a &ldquo;Land of Stevenson,&rdquo; as there is 
already a &ldquo;Land of Burns,&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Land of 
Scott,&rdquo; known to the tourist, bescribbled by the guide-book
maker?&nbsp; This the future must tell.&nbsp; Yet will it be easy
to mark out the bounds of &ldquo;Robert Louis Stevenson&rsquo;s 
Country&rdquo;; and, taking his native and well-loved city for a 
starting-point, a stout walker may visit all its principal sites 
in an afternoon.&nbsp; The house where he was born is within a 
bowshot of the Water of Leith; some five miles to the south are 
Caerketton and Allermuir, and other crests of the Pentlands, and 
below them Swanston Farm, where year after year, in his 
father&rsquo;s time, he spent the summer days basking on the hill
slopes; two or three miles to the westward of Swanston is 
Colinton, where his mother&rsquo;s father, Dr Balfour, was 
minister; and here again you are back to the Water of Leith, 
which you can follow down to the New Town.&nbsp; In this 
triangular space Stevenson&rsquo;s memories and affections were 
firmly rooted; the fibres could not be withdrawn from the soil, 
and &ldquo;the voice of the blood&rdquo; and the longing for this
little piece of earth make themselves plaintively heard in his 
last notes.&nbsp; By Lothian Road, after which Stevenson quaintly
thought of naming the new edition of his works, and past 
Boroughmuirhead and the &ldquo;Bore Stane,&rdquo; where James 
FitzJames set up his standard before Flodden, wends your 
southward way to the hills.&nbsp; The builder of suburban villas 
has pushed his handiwork far into the fields since Stevenson was 
wont to tramp between the city and the Pentlands; and you may 
look in vain for the flat stone whereon, as the marvelling child 
was told, there once rose a &ldquo;crow-haunted 
gibbet.&rdquo;&nbsp; Three-quarters of an hour of easy walking, 
after you have cleared the last of the houses will bring you to 
Swanston; and half an hour more will take the stiff climber, a 
little breathless, to</p>
<h4>THE TOP OF CAERKETTON CRAGS.</h4>
<p>You may follow the high road&mdash;indeed there is a choice of
two, drawn at different levels&mdash;athwart the western skirts 
of the Braid Hills, now tenanted, crown and sides of them, by 
golf; then to the crossroads of Fairmilehead, whence the road 
dips down, to rise again and circumvent the most easterly wing of
the Pentlands.&nbsp; You would like to pursue this route, were it
only to look down on Bow Bridge and recall how the last-century 
gauger used to put together his flute and play &ldquo;Over the 
hills and far away&rdquo; as a signal to his friend in the 
distillery below, now converted into a dairy farm, to stow away 
his barrels.&nbsp; Better it is, however, to climb the stile just
past the poor-house gate, and follow the footpath along the 
smoothly scooped banks of the Braid Burn to 
&ldquo;Cockmylane&rdquo; and to Comiston.&nbsp; The wind has been
busy all the morning spreading the snow over a glittering 
world.&nbsp; The drifts are piled shoulder-high in the lane as it
approaches Comiston, and each old tree grouped around the 
historic mansion is outlined in snow so virgin pure that were the
Ghost&mdash;&ldquo;a lady in white, with the most beautiful clear
shoes on her feet&rdquo;&mdash;to step out through the back gate,
she would be invisible, unless, indeed, she were between you and 
the ivy-draped dovecot wall.&nbsp; Near by, at the corner of the 
Dreghorn Woods, is the Hunters&rsquo; Tryst, on the roof of 
which, when it was still a wayside inn, the Devil was wont to 
dance on windy nights.&nbsp; In the field through which you 
trudge knee-deep in drift rises the &ldquo;Kay Stane,&rdquo; 
looking to-day like a tall monolith of whitest marble.&nbsp; 
Stevenson was mistaken when he said that it was from its top a 
neighbouring laird, on pain of losing his lands, had to 
&ldquo;wind a blast of bugle horn&rdquo; each time the King</p>
<h4>VISITED HIS FOREST OF PENTLAND.</h4>
<p>That honour belongs to another on the adjacent farm of 
Buckstane.&nbsp; The ancient monument carries you further back, 
and there are Celtic authorities that translate its name the 
&ldquo;Stone of Victory.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;Pechtland 
Hills&rdquo;&mdash;their elder name&mdash;were once a refuge for 
the Picts; and Caerketton&mdash;probably Caer-etin, the 
giant&rsquo;s strong-hold&mdash;is one of them.&nbsp; Darkly its 
cliffs frown down upon you, while all else is flashing white in 
the winter sunlight.&nbsp; For once, in this last buttress thrown
out into the plain of Lothian towards the royal city, the outer 
folds of the Pentlands loses its boldly-rounded curves, and drops
an almost sheer descent of black rock to the little glen 
below.&nbsp; In a wrinkle of the foothills Swanston farm and 
hamlet are snugly tucked away.&nbsp; The spirit that breathes 
about it in summer time is gently pastoral.&nbsp; It is sheltered
from the rougher blasts; it is set about with trees and green 
hills.&nbsp; It was with this aspect of the place that Stevenson,
coming hither on holiday, was best acquainted.&nbsp; The village 
green, whereon the windows of the neat white cottages turn a 
kindly gaze under low brows of thatch, is then a perfect place in
which to rest, and, watching the smoke rising and listening to 
&ldquo;the leaves ruffling in the breeze,&rdquo; to muse on men 
and things; especially on Sabbath mornings, when the ploughman or
shepherd, &ldquo;perplext wi&rsquo; leisure,&rdquo; it is time to
set forth on the three-mile walk along the hill-skirts to 
Colinton kirk.&nbsp; But Swanston in winter time must also</p>
<h4>HAVE BEEN FAMILIAR TO STEVENSON.</h4>
<p>Snow-wreathed Pentlands, the ribbed and furrowed front of 
Caerketton, the low sun striking athwart the sloping fields of 
white, the shadows creeping out from the hills, and the frosty 
yellow fog drawing in from the Firth&mdash;must often have 
flashed back on the thoughts of the exile of Samoa.&nbsp; Against
this wintry background the white farmhouse, old and crow-stepped,
looks dingy enough; the garden is heaped with the fantastic 
treasures of the snow; and when you toil heavily up the waterside
to the clump of pines and beeches you find yourself in a fairy 
forest.&nbsp; One need not search to-day for the pool where the 
lynx-eyed John Todd, &ldquo;the oldest herd on the 
Pentlands,&rdquo; watched from behind the low scrag of wood the 
stranger collie come furtively to wash away the tell-tale stains 
of lamb&rsquo;s blood.&nbsp; The effacing hand of the snow has 
smothered it over.&nbsp; Higher you mount, mid leg-deep in drift,
up the steep and slippery hill-face, to the summit.&nbsp; 
Edinburgh has been creeping nearer since Stevenson&rsquo;s musing
fancy began to draw on the memories of the climbs up &ldquo;steep
Caerketton.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this light gives it a mystic 
distance; and it is all glitter and shadow.&nbsp; Arthur Seat is 
like some great sea monster stranded near a city of dreams; from 
the fog-swathed Firth gleams the white walls of Inchkeith 
lighthouse, a mark never missed by Stevenson&rsquo;s 
father&rsquo;s son; above Fife rise the twin breasts of the 
Lomonds.&nbsp; Or turn round and look across the Esk valley to 
the Moorfoots; or more westerly, where the back range of the 
Pentlands&mdash;Caernethy, the Scald, and the knife-edged 
Kips&mdash;draw a sharp silhouette of Arctic peaks against the 
sky.&nbsp; In the cloven hollow between is Glencarse Loch, an 
ancient chapel and burying ground hidden under its waters; on the
slope above it, not a couple miles away, is Rullion Green, where,
as Stevenson told in <i>The Pentland Rising</i> (his first 
printed work)</p>
<h4>THE WESTLAND WHIGS WERE SCATTERED</h4>
<p>as chaff on the hills.&nbsp; Were &ldquo;topmost 
Allermuir,&rdquo; that rises close beside you, removed from his 
place, we might see the gap in the range through which Tom 
Dalyell and his troopers spurred from Currie to the fray.&nbsp; 
The air on these heights is invigorating as wine; but it is also 
keen as a razor.&nbsp; Without delaying long yon plunge down to 
the &ldquo;Windy Door Nick&rdquo;; follow the &ldquo;nameless 
trickle that springs from the green bosom of Allermuir,&rdquo; 
past the rock and pool, where, on summer evenings, the poet 
&ldquo;loved to sit and make bad verses&rdquo;; and cross 
Halkerside and the Shearers&rsquo; Knowe, those &ldquo;adjacent 
cantons on a single shoulder of a hill,&rdquo; sometimes 
floundering to the neck in the loose snow of a drain, sometimes 
scaring the sheep huddling in the wreaths, or putting up a covey 
of moorfowl that circle back without a cry to cover in the 
ling.&nbsp; In an hour you are at Colinton, whose dell has on one
side the manse garden, where a bright-eyed boy, who was to become
famous, spent so much of his time when he came thither on visits 
to his stern Presbyterian grandfather; on the other the old 
churchyard.&nbsp; The snow has drawn its cloak of ermine over the
sleepers, it has run its fingers over the worn lettering; and 
records almost effaced start out from the stone.&nbsp; In vain 
these &ldquo;voices of generations dead&rdquo; summon their 
wandering child, though you might deem that his spirit would rest
more quietly where the cold breeze from Pentland shakes the 
ghostly trees in Colinton Dell than &ldquo;under the flailing 
fans and shadows of the palm.&rdquo;</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
